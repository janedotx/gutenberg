Directions: Each group of questions in this section is based on a set of conditions. In answering some of the questions, it may be
useful to draw a rough diagram. Choose the response that most accurately and completely answers each question and blacken
the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
Questions 1–5
A law firm has seven departments—family law, health law,
injury law, labor law, probate, securities, and tax law. The
firm is to occupy a building with three floors—the bottom
floor, the middle floor, and the top floor. Each floor can
accommodate up to four departments, and no department is to

26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. On the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, a researcher
examined 35 patients with atypical Parkinson’s disease and
compared their eating habits to those of 65 healthy adults.
She found that all of the patients with atypical Parkinson’s
regularly ate the tropical fruits soursop, custard apple, and
pomme cannelle, whereas only 10 of the healthy adults
regularly ate these fruits. From this, she concluded that
eating these fruits causes atypical Parkinson’s.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the researcher’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

For many of the atypical Parkinson’s patients, their
symptoms stopped getting worse, and in some
cases actually abated, when they stopped eating
soursop, custard apple, and pomme cannelle.
Of the healthy adults who did not regularly eat
soursop, custard apple, and pomme cannelle,
most had eaten each of these fruits on at least
one occasion.
In areas other than Guadeloupe, many people
who have never eaten soursop, custard apple,
and pomme cannelle have contracted atypical
Parkinson’s.
The 10 healthy adults who regularly ate
soursop, custard apple, and pomme cannelle
ate significantly greater quantities of these
fruits, on average, than did the 35 atypical
Parkinson’s patients.
Soursop, custard apple, and pomme cannelle
contain essential vitamins not contained in any
other food that is commonly eaten by residents
of Guadeloupe.

2. Price: A corporation’s primary responsibility is to its
shareholders. They are its most important
constituency because they take the greatest risks. If
the corporation goes bankrupt, they lose their
investment.
Albrecht: Shareholders typically have diversified
investment portfolios. For employees, however,
the well-being of the corporation for which they
have chosen to work represents their very
livelihood. The corporation’s primary
responsibility should be to them.
On the basis of their statements, Price and Albrecht are
committed to disagreeing about whether
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

corporations have a responsibility to their
shareholders
corporations are responsible for the welfare of
their employees
means should be provided for a corporation’s
investors to recoup their losses if the
corporation goes bankrupt
a corporation’s shareholders have more at stake
than anyone else does in the corporation’s
success or failure
the livelihood of some of the shareholders
depends on the corporation’s success

3. Despite the enormous number of transactions processed
daily by banks nowadays, if a customer’s bank account
is accidentally credited with a large sum of money, it is
extremely unlikely that the error will not be detected by
the bank’s internal audit procedures.
Which one of the following, if true, most strongly
supports the claim above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Banks initially process all transactions using
one set of computer programs, but then use a
different set of programs to double-check large
transactions.
Recent changes in banking standards require
that customers present identification both when
making deposits into their accounts and when
making withdrawals from their accounts.
Banks are required by law to send each
customer a monthly statement detailing every
transaction of the previous month.
The average ratio of bank auditors to customer
accounts has slowly increased over the past
100 years.
The development of sophisticated security
software has rendered bank computers nearly
impervious to tampering by computer hackers.

4. Scientist: While studying centuries-old Antarctic ice
deposits, I found that several years of relatively
severe atmospheric pollution in the 1500s
coincided with a period of relatively high global
temperatures. So it is clear in this case that
atmospheric pollution did cause global
temperatures to rise.

The cookie company has recently dropped
alphahydroxy acids from its cookie ingredients.
Not all chemicals that are part of the
manufacturing process are ingredients of the
cookies.
The label was printed before the cookie
company decided to switch from sugarcane
alphahydroxy acids to synthesized ones.
Many other foods advertising all natural
ingredients also contain some ingredients that
are chemically synthesized.
All substances except those that do not occur
naturally in any source are considered natural.

6. Although Jaaks is a respected historian, her negative
review of Yancey’s new book on the history of coastal
fisheries in the region rests on a mistake. Jaaks’s review
argues that the book inaccurately portrays the lives of
fishery workers. However, Yancey used the same
research methods in this book as in her other histories,
which have been very popular. This book is also very
popular in local bookstores.

Which one of the following, if true, would most

5. Gilbert: This food label is mistaken. It says that these
cookies contain only natural ingredients, but they
contain alphahydroxy acids that are chemically
synthesized by the cookie company at their plant.
Sabina: The label is not mistaken. After all,
alphahydroxy acids also are found occurring
naturally in sugarcane.

The reasoning in the scientist’s argument is most

presumes, without providing justification, that a
rise in global temperatures is harmful

7. Columnist: It has been noted that attending a live
musical performance is a richer experience than is
listening to recorded music. Some say that this is
merely because we do not see the performers
when we listen to recorded music. However, there
must be some other reason, for there is relatively
little difference between listening to someone
read a story over the radio and listening to
someone in the same room read a story.

experience than is listening to recorded music?

performer and an administrator. Since Leon and Marta
are both members of the Richardson Theater Group but
neither is an administrator, it follows that both are
performers.

(D)
8. Though ice cream is an excellent source of calcium,
dairy farmers report that during the past ten years there
has been a sharp decline in ice cream sales. And during
the same period, sales of cheddar cheese have nearly
doubled. Therefore, more and more people must be
choosing to increase their intake of calcium by eating
cheddar cheese rather than ice cream.

B

Not all of the employees of the Tedenco
Company are salaried employees of that
company. Since Mr. López and Ms. Allen are
both salaried employees of the Tedenco
Company, it follows that they are not the only
employees of the Tedenco Company.
No employee of the Tedenco Company is both
an accountant and a corporate attorney. Since
Ms. Walsh is both an accountant and a
corporate attorney, it follows that she is not an
employee of the Tedenco Company.
No company can have its headquarters in both
Canada and Mexico. Since neither the Dumone
Company nor the Tedenco Company has its
headquarters in Mexico, it follows that both
have their headquarters in Canada.
No corporate attorney represents both the
Dumone Company and the Tedenco Company.
Since Ms. Tseung is a corporate attorney who
represents the Dumone Company, it follows
that she does not also represent the Tedenco
Company.
No member of the board of directors of the
Dumone Company is also a member of the
board of directors of the Tedenco Company.
Since neither company has fewer than five
board members, it follows that both boards
together include at least ten members.

10. Chemical fertilizers not only create potential health
hazards, they also destroy earthworms, which are highly
beneficial to soil. For this reason alone the use of
chemical fertilizers should be avoided. The castings
earthworms leave behind are much richer than the soil
they ingest, thus making a garden rich in earthworms
much more fertile than a garden without them.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Earthworms are highly beneficial to soil.
Chemical fertilizers destroy earthworms.
The castings that earthworms leave behind are
much richer than the soil they ingest.
The use of chemical fertilizers should be
avoided.
A garden rich in earthworms is much more
fertile than a garden that is devoid of
earthworms.

11. Medical research has established that the Beta Diet is
healthier than a more conventional diet. But on average,
people who have followed the Beta Diet for several
decades are much more likely to be in poor health than
are people whose diet is more conventional.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent conflict between the two statements
above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

On average, people who have followed the Beta
Diet for their entire lives are much more likely
to have a variety of healthful habits than are
people whose diet is more conventional.
The Beta Diet is used primarily as a treatment
for a condition that adversely affects overall
health.
People of average health who switch from a
conventional diet to the Beta Diet generally
find that their health improves substantially as
a result.
The Beta Diet provides dramatic health benefits
for some people but only minor benefits for
others.
Recent research has shown that a diet high in
fruits, vegetables, and skim milk is even
healthier than the Beta Diet.

12. A theoretical framework facilitates conceptual
organization of material and fruitful expansions of
research. Many historians argue that historical analysis
is therefore done best within a theoretical framework.
But the past is too complex for all of its main trends to

Therefore, _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the argument?
(A)

(B)

(E)

there is no benefit ever to be gained in
recommending to historians that they place

theoretical frameworks are less useful in history
than they are in any other discipline

history’s main trends

13. Bethany: Psychologists have discovered a technique for
replacing one’s nightmares with pleasant dreams,
and have successfully taught it to adults suffering
from chronic nightmares. Studies have found that
nightmare-prone children are especially likely to
suffer from nightmares as adults. Thus,
psychologists should direct efforts toward
identifying nightmare-prone children so that these
children can be taught the technique for replacing
their nightmares with pleasant dreams.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify drawing the conclusion in Bethany’s
argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Psychologists should make an effort to
determine why certain children are especially
prone to nightmares while other children are
not.
Any psychological technique that can be
successfully taught to a child can also be
successfully taught to an adult.
Psychologists should do everything they can to
minimize the number of adults troubled by
chronic nightmares.
Identifying nightmare-prone children is
generally more difficult than teaching adults
the technique for replacing nightmares with
pleasant dreams.
Psychologists should not teach the technique for
replacing nightmares with pleasant dreams to
children who are unlikely to suffer from
nightmares as adults.

14. At one sitting, a typical doughnut eater consumes
4 doughnuts containing a total of 680 calories and
40 grams of fat. The typical bagel eater consumes exactly
one bagel, at 500 calories and one or two grams of fat
per sitting, though the addition of spreads can raise
calorie and fat content to the four-doughnut range. Thus,
as far as total calorie content is concerned, there is very
little difference between what a typical doughnut eater
and a typical bagel eater each consumes at one sitting.
The argument depends on assuming which one of the
following?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

The calories and fat in bagels have the same
health impact on bagel eaters as the calories
and fat in doughnuts have on doughnut eaters.
Most bagel eaters are not fully aware of the
calorie and fat content of a bagel.
Eating bagels instead of eating doughnuts
provides no real health benefit.
The typical doughnut eater does not add to
doughnuts any substances that increase the
total caloric intake.
Most typical doughnut eaters are not also bagel
eaters.

15. Bowers: A few theorists hold the extreme view that
society could flourish in a condition of anarchy, the
absence of government. Some of these theorists
have even produced interesting arguments to
support that position. One writer, for example,
contends that anarchy is laissez-faire capitalism
taken to its logical extreme. But these theorists’
views ignore the fundamental principle of social
philosophy—that an acceptable social philosophy
must promote peace and order. Any social
philosophy that countenances chaos, i.e., anarchy,
accordingly deserves no further attention.
The reasoning in Bowers’s argument is most vulnerable
to criticism on the grounds that
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

the meaning of a key term shifts illicitly during
the course of the argument
the argument fails to show that laissez-faire
capitalism deserves to be rejected as a social
philosophy
the truth or falsity of a view is not determined
by the number of people who accept it as true
the argument presumes, without providing
justification, that any peaceful society will
flourish
it is unreasonable to reject a view merely
because it can be described as extreme

Students respect honesty above all else.
Students’ respect for a teacher is independent of

Students lose respect for teachers whenever they
sense that the teachers are trying to hide their
ignorance.

18. Contrary to Malthus’s arguments, human food-producing
capacity has increased more rapidly than human
population. Yet, agricultural advances often compromise
biological diversity. Therefore, Malthus’s prediction that
insufficient food will doom humanity to war, pestilence,
and famine will likely be proven correct in the future,
because a lack of biodiversity will eventually erode our
capacity to produce food.

(A)

(C)

B

The conclusion is properly drawn if which one of the
following is assumed?

(A)

(B)

B

17. Teachers should not do anything to cause their students
to lose respect for them. And students can sense when
someone is trying to hide his or her ignorance.
Therefore, a teacher who does not know the answer to a
question a student has asked should not pretend to know
the answer.

The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following
is most similar to that in the argument above?
All squeeze toys, except those designed for cats,
are safe for infants. All squeeze toys are sold
prewrapped. This item is not designed for cats,
and it is sold prewrapped. So it must be safe
for infants.
Aside from the dogcatcher and the police chief,
all of the politicians in town are lawyers. All
of the politicians in town have websites. Sal is
a politician in town, but is neither the
dogcatcher nor the police chief. Since Sal is a
politician in town he must have a website.
All visas are assigned by this office, except for
those that are issued through diplomatic
channels. All visit permits are visas. Thus, the
visit permit in Will’s passport was assigned
through diplomatic channels.
All of this store’s winter garments are on sale,
except for the designer clothes. None of the shirts
in this store are designer clothes. This shirt,
therefore, since it is on sale, is a winter garment.
All residential buildings are subject to the
original fire code, except for those built last
year. All townhouses are residential buildings.
Bloom House was not built last year, and it is
a townhouse, so it is subject to the original fire
code.

It is a hypothesis the argument provides reasons
for believing to be presently false.
It is a part of the evidence used in the argument
to support the conclusion that a well-known
view is misguided.
It is an observation that the argument suggests
actually supports Malthus’s position.
It is a general fact that the argument offers
reason to believe will eventually change.
It is a hypothesis that, according to the
argument, is accepted on the basis of
inadequate evidence.

20. Quality control investigator: Upon testing samples of
products from our supplier that were sent by our
field inspectors from various manufacturing
locations, our laboratory discovered that over
20 percent of the samples were defective. Since our
supplier is contractually required to limit the rate
of defects among items it manufactures for us to
below 5 percent, it has violated its contract with us.
The reasoning in the quality control investigator’s
argument is flawed in that the argument

(E)

bases its conclusion on too small a sample of
items tested by the laboratory
presumes, without providing justification, that
the field inspectors were just as likely to
choose a defective item for testing as they
were to choose a nondefective item
overlooks the possibility that a few of the
manufacturing sites are responsible for most of
the defective items
overlooks the possibility that the field inspectors
tend to choose items for testing that they
suspect are defective
presumes, without providing justification, that
the field inspectors made an equal number of
visits to each of the various manufacturing
sites of the supplier

21. Essayist: When the first prehistoric migrations of
humans from Asia to North America took place,
the small bands of new arrivals encountered many
species of animals that would be extinct only
2,000 years later. Since it is implausible that
hunting by these small bands of humans could
have had such an effect, and since disease-causing
microorganisms not native to North America were
undoubtedly borne by the new arrivals as well as
by the animals that followed them, these
microorganisms were probably the crucial factor
that accounts for the extinctions.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
essayist’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Animals weakened by disease are not only less
able to avoid hunters but are also less able to
avoid their other predators.
Human beings generally have a substantial
degree of biological immunity to the diseases
carried by other species.
Very few species of North American animals
not hunted by the new arrivals from Asia were
extinct 2,000 years after the first migrations.
Individual humans and animals can carry a
disease-causing microorganism without
themselves suffering from the disease.
Some species of North American animals
became extinct more than 2,000 years after the
arrival in North America of the first prehistoric
human migrants from Asia.

22. A recent study confirms that nutritious breakfasts make
workers more productive. For one month, workers at
Plant A received free nutritious breakfasts every day
before work, while workers in Plant B did not. The
productivity of Plant A’s workers increased, while that
of Plant B’s workers did not.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Few workers in Plant B consumed nutritious
breakfasts during the month of the study.
Workers in the study from Plant A and Plant B
started work at the same time of day.
During the month before the study, workers at
Plant A and Plant B were equally productive.
Workers from Plant A took fewer vacation days
per capita during the month than did workers
from Plant B.
Workers in Plant B were more productive
during the month of the study than were
workers from Plant A.

23. This year a flood devastated a small river town.
Hollyville, also a river town, responded with an
outpouring of aid in which a majority of its residents
participated, a proportion that far surpassed that of a few
years ago when Hollyville sent aid to victims of a
highly publicized earthquake. This year’s circumstances
were a reversal of last year’s, when Hollyville itself was
the scene of a deadly tornado and so the recipient rather
than the supplier of emergency aid.
The situation described above most closely conforms to
which one of the following generalizations?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

People are more likely to aid people they know
than they are to aid strangers.
Those who have received aid are more likely to
be in favor of government relief programs than
are those who have not.
The amount of aid that victims of a disaster
receive is unrelated to the extent to which the
disaster is publicized.
Once a disaster has struck them, people are
more likely to aid others in need than they
were before the disaster.
People are more likely to aid those who have
experienced a hardship similar to one they
themselves have experienced than to aid those
who have experienced a dissimilar hardship.

24. Market analyst: According to my research, 59 percent of
consumers anticipate paying off their credit card
balances in full before interest charges start to
accrue, intending to use the cards only to avoid
carrying cash and writing checks. This research
also suggests that in trying to win business from
their competitors, credit card companies tend to
concentrate on improving the services their
customers are the most interested in. Therefore,
my research would lead us to expect that _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the market analyst’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

most consumers would be indifferent about
which company’s credit card they use
credit card companies would not make the
interest rates they charge on cards the main
selling point
most consumers would prefer paying interest on
credit card debts over borrowing money from
banks
most consumers would ignore the length of time
a credit card company allows to pay the
balance due before interest accrues
the most intense competition among credit card
companies would be over the number of places
that they can get to accept their credit card

25. About 3 billion years ago, the Sun was only 80 percent
as luminous as it is currently. Such conditions today
would result in the freezing of Earth’s oceans, but
geological evidence shows that water rather than ice filled
the oceans at that time. Heat is trapped within Earth’s
atmosphere through the presence of carbon dioxide,
which, like methane, is a “greenhouse gas.” Only if the
level of greenhouse gases were higher 3 billion years ago
than it is today would Earth have retained enough heat to
keep the oceans from freezing. It is likely, therefore, that
the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was
significantly higher then than it is today.

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Sufficient heat to keep the oceans liquid
3 billion years ago could not have been
generated through geological processes such as
volcanic activity.
Geological studies indicate that there is much
less methane in Earth’s atmosphere today than
there was 3 billion years ago.
Geological evidence indicates that the oceans
contained greater amounts of dissolved
minerals 3 billion years ago, but not enough to
alter their freezing points significantly.
The increase in the Sun’s luminosity over the
past 3 billion years roughly coincided with an
increasing complexity of life forms on Earth.
Because the distance from Earth to the Sun has
not changed significantly over the last 3 billion
years, the increase in the Sun’s luminosity has
resulted in more radiation reaching Earth.

26. Commentator: For a free market to function properly,
each prospective buyer of an item must be able to
contact a large number of independent
prospective sellers and compare the prices
charged for the item to what the item is worth.
Thus, despite advertised prices and written
estimates available from many of its individual
businesses, the auto repair industry does not
constitute a properly functioning free market.
The conclusion of the commentator’s argument follows
logically if which one of the following is assumed?
(A)

Which one of the following, if true, weakens the
argument?
(A)

B

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

People do not usually shop for auto repairs but
instead take their autos to their regular repair
shop out of habit.
Some persons who are shopping for auto repairs
cannot determine what these repairs are worth.
Not all auto repair shops give customers written
estimates.
Many auto repair shops charge more for auto
repairs than these repairs are worth.
Because it is not regulated, the auto repair
industry does not have standardized prices.

questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. New technologies that promise to extend life and
decrease pain involve innovations that require extensive
scientific research. Therefore, investment in such
technologies is very risky, because innovations requiring
extensive scientific research also require large amounts
of capital but are unlikely to provide any financial
return. Nonetheless, some people are willing to invest in
these new technologies.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain why some people are willing to invest in new
technologies that promise to extend life and decrease pain?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

When investments in new technologies that
promise to extend life and decrease pain do
provide financial return, they generally return
many times the original investment, which is
much more than the return on safer investments.
A large variety of new technologies that
promise to extend life and decrease pain have
been developed in the last decade.
The development of certain new technologies
other than those that promise to extend life and
decrease pain is also very risky, because these
technologies require large amounts of capital
but are unlikely to provide any financial return.
Some investments that initially seem likely to
provide reasonably large financial return
ultimately provide no financial return.
The scientific research necessary to develop
new technologies that promise to extend life
and decrease pain sometimes leads to no
greater understanding of the natural world.

2. A university psychology department received a large
donation from a textbook company after agreeing to use
one of the company’s books for a large introductory
course. The department chair admitted that the
department would not have received the donation if it
used another company’s textbook, but insisted that the
book was chosen solely for academic reasons. As proof,
she noted that the department’s textbook committee had
given that textbook its highest rating.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
case for the department chair’s position?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

The members of the textbook committee were
favorably influenced toward the textbook by
the prospect of their department receiving a
large donation.
The department has a long-standing policy of
using only textbooks that receive the
committee’s highest rating.
In the previous year, a different textbook from
the same company was used in the
introductory course.
The department chair is one of the members of
the textbook committee.
The textbook company does not routinely make
donations to academic departments that use its
books.

3. Hemoglobin, a substance in human blood, transports
oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. With
each oxygen molecule it picks up, a hemoglobin
molecule becomes more effective at picking up
additional oxygen molecules until its maximum capacity
of four oxygen molecules is reached. Grabbing an
oxygen molecule changes the shape of the hemoglobin
molecule, each time causing it literally to open itself to
receive more oxygen.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A hemoglobin molecule that has picked up three
oxygen molecules will probably acquire a
fourth oxygen molecule.
The only factor determining how effective a
hemoglobin molecule is at picking up oxygen
molecules is how open the shape of that
hemoglobin molecule is.
A hemoglobin molecule that has picked up three
oxygen molecules will be more effective at
picking up another oxygen molecule than will
a hemoglobin molecule that has picked up only
one oxygen molecule.
A hemoglobin molecule that has picked up four
oxygen molecules will have the same shape as
a hemoglobin molecule that has not picked up
any oxygen molecules.
Each hemoglobin molecule in human blood
picks up between one and four oxygen
molecules in or near the lungs and transports
them to some other part of the body.

4. On a short trip a driver is more likely to have an
accident if there is a passenger in the car, presumably
because passengers distract drivers. However, on a long
trip a driver is more likely to have an accident if the
driver is alone.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the facts described above?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

People are much more likely to drive alone on
short trips than on long trips.
Good drivers tend to take more long trips than
bad drivers.
The longer a car trip is, the more likely a
passenger is to help the driver maintain
alertness.
On a long trip the likelihood of an accident
does not increase with each additional
passenger.
Most drivers take far more short trips than long
trips.

5. Challenger: The mayor claims she has vindicated those
who supported her in the last election by fulfilling
her promise to increase employment opportunities
in our city, citing the 8 percent increase in the
number of jobs in the city since she took office.
But during her administration, the national
government relocated an office to our city,
bringing along nearly the entire staff from the
outside. The 8 percent increase merely represents
the jobs held by these newcomers.
Mayor: Clearly my opponent does not dispute the
employment statistics. The unemployed voters in
this city want jobs. The 8 percent increase in the
number of jobs during my term exceeds that of
any of my predecessors.
As a response to the challenger, the mayor’s answer is
flawed in that it
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

takes for granted that those who supported the
mayor in the last election believed job
availability to be a significant city issue
does not consider whether the number of
unemployed persons within the city represents
more than 8 percent of the eligible voters
fails to address the challenger’s objection that
the 8 percent increase did not result in an
increase in job availability for those who lived
in the city at the time of the last election
ignores the challenger’s contention that the
influx of newcomers during the mayor’s
administration has increased the size of the
voting public and altered its priorities

6. A recent magazine editorial criticizes psychologists for
not attempting to establish the order in which different
areas of the brain are activated during a cognitive task
such as imagining the face of a friend. However, the
editorial is unfair because there is currently no
technology that can detect the order of activation of
brain areas.
Which one of the following most closely conforms to
the principle to which the reasoning in the passage
conforms?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Construction companies have been unfairly
criticized for using fewer layers of heating
insulation in new houses than the number of
layers used in previous years. Recent
technology has made insulation more efficient,
so fewer layers are required.
Utility companies have been unfairly criticized
for not using nuclear fusion to meet the
nation’s electricity needs. There is no way to
harness fusion that could produce enough
electricity to supply even one small town.
The food industry has been unfairly criticized
for attempting to preserve food longer by
treating it with radiation. If food remained
edible for longer, the cost of food would
decrease substantially.
The school system has been unfairly criticized
for not making familiarity with computer
technology a requirement. Computer studies
could not be added to the curriculum without
sacrificing some other subject.
CEOs of large companies have been unfairly
criticized for not always using their knowledge
of economic theory to run their companies.
Economic theory is sometimes irrelevant to
making wise corporate decisions.

7. Although most people know what their bad habits are
and want to rid themselves of them, a majority of these
people find it very difficult to do so. This is because
cessation of habitual behavior is immediately and
vividly painful, while whatever benefit is to be gained
by the absence of the habit is perceived only dimly
because it is remote.

civilization, the better they understand its intellectual
achievements. Not only were numerous scientific
observations and predictions made by Mayan
astronomers, but the people in general seem to have had
a strong grasp of sophisticated mathematical concepts.
We know this from the fact that the writings of the
Mayan religious scribes exhibit a high degree of
mathematical competence.
The argument’s reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism
on the grounds that the argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

fails to provide an adequate definition of the
term “intellectual achievement”
bases a generalization on a sample that is likely
to be unrepresentative
overlooks the impressive achievements of other
past civilizations
relies on two different senses of the term
“scientific”
takes a mere correlation to be evidence of a
causal relationship

9. Manager: There is no good reason to suppose that
promoting creativity is a proper goal of an
employee training program. Many jobs require
little or no creativity and, in those positions, using
creativity is more likely to be disruptive than
innovative. Furthermore, even if creativity were
in demand, there is no evidence that it can be
taught.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion drawn in the manager’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Using creativity in jobs that require little or no
creativity can be disruptive.
Employee training programs are not able to
teach employees creativity.
Many jobs require little or no creativity.
There is no good reason to suppose that
employee training programs should promote
creativity.
Creativity is in demand, but there is no
evidence that it can be taught.

The information above most strongly supports the
statement that the people who are most successful at

can vividly imagine remote but attainable
benefit
can vividly imagine their present pain being felt

10. Producer: It has been argued that, while the government
should not censor television shows, the public
should boycott the advertisers of shows that
promote violence and erode our country’s values.
But this would be censorship nonetheless, for if
the public boycotted the advertisers, then they
would cancel their advertisements, causing some
shows to go off the air; the result would be a
restriction of the shows that the public can watch.
The producer’s conclusion is properly inferred if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

If there is neither government censorship nor
boycotting of advertisers, there will be no
restriction of the television shows that the
public can watch.
Public boycotts could force some shows off the
air even though the shows neither promote
violence nor erode values.
For any television show that promotes violence
and erodes values, there will be an audience.
There is widespread public agreement about
which television shows promote violence and
erode values.
Any action that leads to a restriction of what
the public can view is censorship.

11. Predictions that printed books will soon be replaced by
books in electronic formats such as CD-ROM are
exaggerated. While research libraries may find an
electronic format more convenient for scholars and
scientists, bookstores and public libraries will stock
books in the format desired by the general public, which
will be something other than an electronic format.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Scholars and scientists find an electronic format
for books the most convenient one for quick
searching and cross-referencing.
Publishers will continue to print books in the
format stocked by bookstores and public
libraries.
Scholars and scientists do not usually conduct
their research in public libraries.
At some bookstores and libraries, the popularity
of books on tape and of videos is beginning to
rival that of printed books.
Some members of the general public prefer to
purchase books in an electronic format rather
than borrow them from the library.

12. To cut costs, a high school modified its air-conditioning
system to increase its efficiency. The modified system,
however, caused the humidity in the school air to
decrease by 18 percent. Twenty-four hours after the
decrease in air humidity, a 25 percent increase in the
number of visits to the school nurse was reported. This
shows that a decrease in humidity can make people ill.
The argument depends on assuming which one of the
following?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

At least some of the visits to the school nurse
after the system was modified were due to
illness.
Most of the students at the high school suffered
from the decrease in air humidity.
It takes 24 hours after a person is infected with
a virus for that person to exhibit symptoms.
A decrease of 18 percent in air humidity causes
an increase of 25 percent in one’s probability
of becoming ill.
Modifying the air-conditioning system proved to
be an ineffective way to cut costs.

13. A recent study of 10,000 people who were involved in
automobile accidents found that a low percentage of
those driving large automobiles at the time of their
accidents were injured, but a high percentage of those
who were driving small automobiles at the time of their
accidents were injured. Thus, one is less likely to be
injured in an automobile accident if one drives a large
car rather than a small car.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Most of the accidents analyzed in the study
occurred in areas with very high speed limits.
Most people who own small cars also drive
large cars on occasion.
Half of the study participants drove
medium-sized cars at the time of their
accidents.
A large automobile is far more likely to be
involved in an accident than is a small
automobile.
Only a small percentage of those people
involved in an automobile accident are injured
as a result.

claiming that a crucial assumption entails a
falsehood
demonstrating that an analogy explicitly used to

15. There are circumstances in which it is not immoral to
make certain threats, and there are circumstances in
which it is not immoral to ask for money or some other
favor. Therefore, there are circumstances in which it is

There are many business events for which
casual dress is appropriate, and there are many
social events for which casual dress is

dress is not likely to be appropriate.
It is usually easy to move a piano after you

16. A common genetic mutation that lowers levels of the
enzyme cathepsin C severely reduces a person’s ability
to ward off periodontitis, or gum disease. The enzyme
triggers immunological reactions that destroy diseased
cells and eliminate infections in the mouth. But
researchers are developing ways to restore the enzyme
to normal levels. Once that happens, we will be able to
eliminate periodontitis.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Restoring cathepsin C to normal levels is the
only way to eliminate periodontitis.
Genetic mutation is the only cause of lowered
levels of cathepsin C.
Researchers will soon succeed in finding means
of restoring cathepsin C to normal levels.
Persons who do not have the genetic mutation
that lowers levels of cathepsin C do not get
gum disease.
A person whose cathepsin C level has been
restored to normal will not suffer from
periodontitis.

17. A recent study of major motion pictures revealed that
the vast majority of their plots were simply variations
on plots that had been used many times before. Despite
this fact, many people enjoy seeing several new movies
each year.
Each of the following, if true, would contribute to an
explanation of the apparent discrepancy in the
information above EXCEPT:
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Movies based on standard plots are more likely
to be financially successful than are ones based
on original plots.
If the details of their stories are sufficiently
different, two movies with the same basic plot
will be perceived by moviegoers as having
different plots.
Because of the large number of movies
produced each year, the odds of a person
seeing two movies with the same general plot
structure in a five-year period are fairly low.
A certain aesthetic pleasure is derived from
seeing several movies that develop the same
plot in slightly different ways.
Although most modern movie plots have been
used before, most of those previous uses
occurred during the 1940s and 1950s.

18. Those who claim that governments should not continue
to devote resources to space exploration are wrong.
Although most people’s lives are relatively unaffected
by the direct consequences of space exploration, many
modern technologies that have a tremendous impact on
daily life—e.g., fiber optics, computers, and lasers—are
unexpected consequences of it. Society might have
missed the benefits of these technologies if governments
had not devoted resources to space exploration.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the principle underlying the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Governments should not be prevented from
allocating resources to projects whose intended
consequences do not directly benefit most
people.
One can never underestimate the beneficial
consequences of government support of
ambitious technological undertakings.
The less practical the goal of a
government-supported project, the more
unexpected the consequences of that project.
Governments should continue to support those
projects that have, in the past, produced
unintended benefits.
In attempting to advance the welfare of society,
governments should continue to dedicate
resources to ambitious technological
undertakings.

19. If understanding a word always involves knowing its
dictionary definition, then understanding a word requires
understanding the words that occur in that definition.
But clearly there are people—for example, all babies—
who do not know the dictionary definitions of some of
the words they utter.
Which one of the following statements follows logically
from the statements above?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Some babies utter individual words that they do
not understand.
Any number of people can understand some
words without knowing their dictionary
definitions.
If some words can be understood without
knowing their dictionary definitions, then
babies understand some words.
If it is possible to understand a word without
knowing its dictionary definition, then it is
possible to understand a word without having
to understand any other word.
If some babies understand all the words they
utter, then understanding a word does not
always involve knowing its dictionary
definition.

20. The peppered moth avoids predators by blending into its
background, typically the bark of trees. In the late
nineteenth century, those peppered moths with the
lightest pigmentation had the greatest contrast with their
backgrounds, and therefore were the most likely to be
seen and eaten by predators. It follows, then, that the
darkest peppered moths were the least likely to be seen
and eaten.
Which one of the following most accurately describes a
flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The argument overlooks the possibility that
light peppered moths had more predators than
dark peppered moths.
The argument takes for granted that peppered
moths are able to control the degree to which
they blend into their backgrounds.
The argument presumes, without providing
justification, that all peppered moths with the
same coloring had the same likelihood of
being seen and eaten by a predator.
The argument overlooks the possibility that
there were peppered moths of intermediate
color that contrasted less with their backgrounds
than the darkest peppered moths did.
The argument presumes, without providing
justification, that the only defense mechanism
available to peppered moths was to blend into
their backgrounds.

21. Historian: The standard “QWERTY” configuration of
the keys on typewriters and computer keyboards
was originally designed to be awkward and limit
typing speed. This was because early typewriters
would jam frequently if adjacent keys were struck
in quick succession. Experiments have shown that
keyboard configurations more efficient than
QWERTY can double typing speed while
tremendously reducing typing effort. However,
the expense and inconvenience of switching to a
new keyboard configuration prevent any
configuration other than QWERTY from attaining
widespread use.

C

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most people who have tried typing with
non-QWERTY keyboards have typed
significantly more quickly using those
keyboards than they usually have done using
QWERTY keyboards.
Early QWERTY typewriters were less likely to
jam than were at least some more recent
typewriters if adjacent keys were struck in
quick succession.
If the designers of early typewriters had
foreseen the possibility that technology would
make it possible for adjacent keyboard keys to
be struck in rapid succession without jamming,
then they would not have proposed the
QWERTY configuration.
The benefit to society that would result from
switching to a keyboard configuration other
than QWERTY is significantly greater than the
overall cost of such a switch.
If the keyboard had been designed for
computers, then it would not have been
designed to limit typing speed.

22. Since anyone who makes an agreement has an
obligation to fulfill the terms of that agreement, it
follows that anyone who is obligated to perform an
action has agreed to perform that action. Hence, saying
that one has a legal obligation to perform a given action
is the same as saying that one is required to fulfill one’s
agreement to perform that action.
Which one of the following statements most accurately
characterizes the argument’s reasoning flaws?
(A)

Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the historian’s statements?
(A)

C

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The argument fails to make a crucial distinction
between an action one is legally obligated to
perform and an action with good
consequences, and it takes for granted that
everything true of legal obligations is true of
obligations generally.
The argument takes for granted that there are
obligations other than those resulting from
agreements made, and it fails to consider the
possibility that actions that uphold agreements
made are sometimes performed for reasons
other than to uphold those agreements.
The argument contains a premise that is
logically equivalent to its conclusion, and it
takes for granted that there are only certain
actions that one should agree to perform.
The argument treats a condition that is sufficient
to make something an obligation as also a
requirement for something to be an obligation,
and it takes for granted that any obligation to
perform an action is a legal obligation.
The argument rests on an ambiguous use of the
term “action,” and it fails to consider the
possibility that people are sometimes unwilling
to perform actions that they have agreed to
perform.

23. To predict that a device will be invented, one must
develop a conception of the device that includes some
details at least about how it will function and the
consequences of its use. But clearly, then, the notion of
predicting an invention is self-contradictory, for
inventing means developing a detailed conception, and
one cannot predict what has already taken place.

the technique of reasoning employed by the argument?
(A)

successful in providing an understanding of all art,
including early abstract art, until the 1960s, when artists
self-consciously rebelled against earlier notions of art.
Since the work of these rebellious artists is quite
beautiful but outside the bounds of the aesthetic theory

25. Science writer: All scientists have beliefs and values
that might slant their interpretations of the data
from which they draw their conclusions.
However, serious scientific papers are carefully
reviewed by many other scientists before
publication. These reviewers are likely to notice
and object to biases that they do not share. Thus,
any slanted interpretations of scientific data will
generally have been removed before publication.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the science writer’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The scientists reviewing serious scientific
papers for publication do not always have
biases likely to slant their interpretations of the
data in those papers.
In general, biases that slant interpretations of
data in serious scientific papers being reviewed
for publication are not shared among all
scientists.
Biases that are present in published scientific
papers and shared by most scientists, including
those who review the papers, are unlikely to
impair the scientific value of those papers.
The interpretation of data is the only part of a
serious scientific paper that is sometimes
slanted by the beliefs and values of scientists.
Slanted interpretations of data in a scientific
paper can be removed only through careful
review by scientists who do not share the
biases of the author or authors of the paper.

Passage A
Recent studies have shown that sophisticated
computer models of the oceans and atmosphere are
capable of simulating large-scale climate trends with
remarkable accuracy. But these models make use of
large numbers of variables, many of which have wide
ranges of possible values. Because even small
differences in those values can have a significant
impact on what the simulations predict, it is important
to determine the impact when values differ even
slightly.
Since the interactions between the many variables
in climate simulations are highly complex, there is no
alternative to a “brute force” exploration of all
possible combinations of their values if predictions
are to be reliable. This method requires very large
numbers of calculations and simulation runs. For
example, exhaustive examination of five values for
each of only nine variables would require 2 million
calculation-intensive simulation runs. Currently
available individual computers are completely
inadequate for such a task.
However, the continuing increase in computing
capacity of the average desktop computer means that
climate simulations can now be run on privately
owned desktop machines connected to one another
via the Internet. The calculations are divided among
the individual desktop computers, which work
simultaneously on their share of the overall problem.
Some public resource computing projects of this kind
have already been successful, although only when
they captured the public’s interest sufficiently to
secure widespread participation.
Passage B
Researchers are now learning that many problems
in nature, human society, science, and engineering are
naturally “parallel”; that is, that they can be
effectively solved by using methods that work
simultaneously in parallel. These problems share the
common characteristic of involving a large number of
similar elements such as molecules, animals, even
people, whose individual actions are governed by
simple rules but, taken collectively, function as a
highly complex system.
An example is the method used by ants to forage
for food. As Lewis Thomas observed, a solitary ant is
little more than a few neurons strung together by
fibers. Its behavior follows a few simple rules. But
when one sees a dense mass of thousands of ants,
crowded together around their anthill retrieving food
or repelling an intruder, a more complex picture

(50)

(55)

(60)

(65)

emerges; it is as if the whole is thinking, planning,
calculating. It is an intelligence, a kind of live
computer, with crawling bits for wits.
We are now living through a great paradigm shift
in the field of computing, a shift from sequential
computing (performing one calculation at a time) to
massive parallel computing, which employs
thousands of computers working simultaneously to
solve one computation-intensive problem. Since many
computation-intensive problems are inherently
parallel, it only makes sense to use a computing
model that exploits that parallelism. A computing
model that resembles the inherently parallel problem
it is trying to solve will perform best. The old
paradigm, in contrast, is subject to the speed limits
imposed by purely sequential computing.

1. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of passage B?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Many difficult problems in computing are
naturally parallel.
Sequential computing is no longer useful
because of the speed limits it imposes.
There is currently a paradigm shift occurring in
the field of computing toward parallel
computing.
Complex biological and social systems are the
next frontier in the field of computer
simulation.
Inherently parallel computing problems are best
solved by means of computers modeled on the
human mind.

are most analogous to which one of the following
elements in passage B?

the thousands of computers working
simultaneously to solve a calculation-intensive
problem
the simple rules that shape the behavior of a

computing

3. It can be inferred that the authors of the two passages
would be most likely to agree on which one of the
following statements concerning computing systems?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Massive, parallel computing systems are able to
solve complex computation-intensive problems
without having to resort to “brute force.”
Computer models are not capable of simulating
the behavior of very large biological
populations such as insect colonies.
Parallel computing systems that link privately
owned desktop computers via the Internet are
not feasible because they rely too heavily on
public participation.
Currently available computers are not
well-suited to running simulations, even if the
simulated problems are relatively simple.
Parallel computing systems employing multiple
computers are the best means for simulating
large-scale climate trends.

A proficiency in understanding, applying, and even
formulating statutes—the actual texts of laws enacted
by legislative bodies—is a vital aspect of the practice
of law, but statutory law is often given too little
attention by law schools. Much of legal education, with
its focus on judicial decisions and analysis of cases,
can give a law student the impression that the practice
of law consists mainly in analyzing past cases to
determine their relevance to a client’s situation and
arriving at a speculative interpretation of the law
relevant to the client’s legal problem.
Lawyers discover fairly soon, however, that much
of their practice does not depend on the kind of
painstaking analysis of cases that is performed in law
school. For example, a lawyer representing the owner
of a business can often find an explicit answer as to
what the client should do about a certain tax-related
issue by consulting the relevant statutes. In such a case
the facts are clear and the statutes’ relation to them
transparent, so that the client’s question can be
answered by direct reference to the wording of the
statutes. But statutes’ meanings and their applicability
to relevant situations are not always so obvious, and
that is one reason that the ability to interpret them
accurately is an essential skill for law students to learn.
Another skill that teaching statutory law would
improve is synthesis. Law professors work hard at
developing their students’ ability to analyze individual
cases, but in so doing they favor the ability to apply the
law in particular cases over the ability to understand
the interrelations among laws. In contrast, the study of
all the statutes of a legal system in a certain small area
of the law would enable the student to see how these
laws form a coherent whole. Students would then be
able to apply this ability to synthesize in other areas of
statutory law that they encounter in their study or
practice. This is especially important because most
students intend to specialize in a chosen area, or areas,
of the law.
One possible argument against including training in
statutory law as a standard part of law school curricula
is that many statutes vary from region to region within
a nation, so that the mastery of a set of statutes would
usually not be generally applicable. There is some truth
to this objection; law schools that currently provide
some training in statutes generally intend it as a
preparation for practice in their particular region, but
for schools that are nationally oriented, this could seem
to be an inappropriate investment of time and
resources. But while the knowledge of a particular
region’s statutory law is not generally transferable to
other regions, the skills acquired in mastering a
particular set of statutes are, making the study of
statutory law an important undertaking even for law
schools with a national orientation.

the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In spite of the reservations that nationally
oriented law schools can be expected to have,
law schools can serve the overall needs of law
students better by implementing a standard
national curriculum in statutory law.
Since the skills promoted by the study of
statutory law are ultimately more important than
those promoted by case analysis, the relative
emphasis that law schools place on these two
areas should be reversed.
Although statutes typically vary from region to
region, law schools should provide training in
statutory law in order to develop students’
ability to synthesize legal information and
interpret individual statutes.
In the theoretical world of law school training, as
opposed to the actual practice of law, a
proficiency in case law is often one of the most
important assets that students can have.
Law schools generally are deficient in their
attention to statutory law training and therefore
fail to impart the skills necessary for the analysis
of legal information.

10. Which one of the following is cited in the passage as a
reason that might be given for not including statutory
law training in law school curricula?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Such training would divert resources away from
the far more important development of the
ability to analyze cases.
Such training is not essentially different from
what is already provided in the core areas of law
school education.
The goals of such training can better be achieved
by other means, most of which are more directly
related to the actual practice of law.
Such training would be irrelevant for those
students who do not plan to specialize.
The lack of geographic uniformity among
statutory laws makes expertise in the statutes of
any particular region generally nontransferable.

currently offered in most law schools?

D

-27-

While nationally oriented law schools have been
deficient in statutory law training, most
regionally oriented law schools have been
equally deficient in the teaching of case law.
Training in statutory law would help lawyers
resolve legal questions for which the answers are
not immediately apparent in the relevant
statutes.
Lawyers who are trained in statutory law
typically also develop a higher level of
efficiency in manipulating details of past cases
as compared with lawyers who are not trained in
this way.
Courses in statutory law are less effective if they
focus specifically on the statutes of a particular
region or in a particular area of the law.
Lawyers who do not specialize probably have
little need for training in statutory law beyond a
brief introduction to the subject.

The Japanese American sculptor Isamu Noguchi
(1904–1988) was an artist who intuitively asked—and
responded to—deeply original questions. He might
well have become a scientist within a standard
scientific discipline, but he instead became an artist
who repeatedly veered off at wide angles from the
well-known courses followed by conventionally
talented artists of both the traditional and modern
schools. The story behind one particular sculpture
typifies this aspect of his creativeness.
By his early twenties, Noguchi’s sculptures
showed such exquisite comprehension of human
anatomy and deft conceptual realization that he won a
Guggenheim Fellowship for travel in Europe. After
arriving in Paris in 1927, Noguchi asked the
Romanian-born sculptor Constantin Brancusi if he
might become his student. When Brancusi said no,
that he never took students, Noguchi asked if he
needed a stonecutter. Brancusi did. Noguchi cut and
polished stone for Brancusi in his studio, frequently
also polishing Brancusi’s brass and bronze sculptures.
Noguchi, with his scientist’s mind, pondered the fact
that sculptors through the ages had relied exclusively
upon negative light—that is, shadows—for their
conceptual communication, precisely because no
metals, other than the expensive, nonoxidizing gold,
could be relied upon to give off positive-light reflections.
Noguchi wanted to create a sculpture that was
purely reflective. In 1929, after returning to the
United States, he met the architect and philosopher
R. Buckminster Fuller, offering to sculpt a portrait of
him. When Fuller heard of Noguchi’s ideas regarding
positive-light sculpture, he suggested using chromenickel steel, which Henry Ford, through automotive
research and development, had just made
commercially available for the first time in history.
Here, finally, was a permanently reflective surface,
economically available in massive quantities.
In sculpting his portrait of Fuller, Noguchi did not
think of it as merely a shiny alternate model of
traditional, negative-light sculptures. What he saw
was that completely reflective surfaces provided a
fundamental invisibility of surface like that of utterly
still waters, whose presence can be apprehended only
when objects—a ship’s mast, a tree, or sky—are reflected
in them. Seaplane pilots making offshore landings in
dead calm cannot tell where the water is and must
glide in, waiting for the unpredictable touchdown.
Noguchi conceived a similarly invisible sculpture,
hidden in and communicating through the reflections
of images surrounding it. Then only the distortion of
familiar shapes in the surrounding environment could
be seen by the viewer. The viewer’s awareness of the
“invisible” sculpture’s presence and dimensional
relationships would be derived only secondarily.
Even after this stunning discovery, Noguchi
remained faithful to his inquisitive nature. At the
moment when his explorations had won critical
recognition of the genius of his original and
fundamental conception, Noguchi proceeded to the
next phase of his evolution.

that does not similarly lose its reflective properties

it is a metal, is long lasting and nonmetallic
materials that are highly reflective but
impermanent
a highly reflective metal that was acceptable to
both traditional and modern sculptors and
highly reflective metals whose use in sculpture
was purely experimental

author would agree with which one of the following
statements?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Noguchi’s work in Paris contributed
significantly to the art of sculpture in that it
embodied solutions to problems that other
sculptors, including Brancusi, had sought
unsuccessfully to overcome.
Noguchi’s scientific approach to designing
sculptures and to selecting materials for
sculptures is especially remarkable in that he
had no formal scientific training.
Despite the fact that Brancusi was a sculptor
and Fuller was not, Fuller played a more
pivotal role than did Brancusi in Noguchi’s
realization of the importance of negative light
to the work of previous sculptors.
Noguchi was more interested in addressing
fundamental aesthetic questions than in
maintaining a consistent artistic style.
Noguchi’s work is of special interest for what it
reveals not only about the value of scientific
thinking in the arts but also about the value of
aesthetic approaches to scientific inquiry.

19. In which one of the following is the relation between
the two people most analogous to the relation between
Ford and Noguchi as indicated by the passage?
(A)

(B)

(E)

A building-materials dealer decides to market a
new type of especially durable simulated-wood
flooring material after learning that a famous
architect has praised the material.
An expert skier begins experimenting with the
use of a new type of material in the soles of
ski boots after a shoe manufacturer suggests
that that material might be appropriate for that use.
A producer of shipping containers begins using
a new type of strapping material, which a rockclimbing expert soon finds useful as an
especially strong and reliable component of
safety ropes for climbing.
A consultant to a book editor suggests the use
of a new type of software for typesetting, and
after researching the software the editor
decides not to adopt it but finds a better
alternative as a result of the research.
A friend of a landscaping expert advises the use
of a certain material for the creation of
retaining walls and, as a result, the landscaper
explores the use of several similar materials.

20. The passage most strongly supports which one of the
following inferences?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Prior to suggesting the sculptural use of chromenickel steel to Noguchi, Fuller himself had
made architectural designs that called for the
use of this material.
Noguchi believed that the use of industrial
materials to create sculptures would make the
sculptures more commercially viable.
Noguchi’s “invisible” sculpture appears to have
no shape or dimensions of its own, but rather
those of surrounding objects.
If a positive-light sculpture depicting a person in
a realistic manner were coated with a metal
subject to oxidation, it would eventually cease
to be recognizable as a realistic likeness.
The perception of the shape and dimensions of a
negative-light sculpture does not depend on its
reflection of objects from the environment
around it.

21. Which one of the following inferences about the
portrait of Fuller does the passage most strongly
support?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The material that Noguchi used in it had been
tentatively investigated by other sculptors but not
in direct connection with its reflective
properties.
It was similar to at least some of the sculptures
that Noguchi produced prior to 1927 in that it
represented a human form.
Noguchi did not initially think of it as especially
innovative or revolutionary and thus was
surprised by Fuller’s reaction to it.
It was produced as a personal favor to Fuller
and thus was not initially intended to be
noticed and commented on by art critics.
It was unlike the sculptures that Noguchi had
helped Brancusi to produce in that the latter’s
aesthetic effects did not depend on contrasts of
light and shadow.

22. Which one of the following would, if true, most
weaken the author’s position in the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Between 1927 and 1929, Brancusi experimented
with the use of highly reflective material for
the creation of positive-light sculptures.
After completing the portrait of Fuller, Noguchi
produced only a few positive-light sculptures
and in fact changed his style of sculpture
repeatedly throughout his career.
When Noguchi arrived in Paris, he was already
well aware of the international acclaim that
Brancusi’s sculptures were receiving at the time.
Many of Noguchi’s sculptures were, unlike the
portrait of Fuller, entirely abstract.
Despite his inquisitive and scientific approach to
the art of sculpture, Noguchi neither thought of
himself as a scientist nor had extensive
scientific training.

In an experiment, two strangers are given the
opportunity to share $100, subject to the following
constraints: One person—the “proposer”—is to
suggest how to divide the money and can make only
one such proposal. The other person—the
“responder”—must either accept or reject the offer
without qualification. Both parties know that if the
offer is accepted, the money will be split as agreed,
but if the offer is rejected, neither will receive
anything.
This scenario is called the Ultimatum Game.
Researchers have conducted it numerous times with a
wide variety of volunteers. Many participants in the
role of the proposer seem instinctively to feel that
they should offer 50 percent to the responder, because
such a division is “fair” and therefore likely to be
accepted. Two-thirds of proposers offer responders
between 40 and 50 percent. Only 4 in 100 offer less
than 20 percent. Offering such a small amount is
quite risky; most responders reject such offers. This is
a puzzle: Why would anyone reject an offer as too
small? Responders who reject an offer receive
nothing, so if one assumes—as theoretical economics
traditionally has—that people make economic
decisions primarily out of rational self-interest, one
would expect that an individual would accept any
offer.
Some theorists explain the insistence on fair
divisions in the Ultimatum Game by citing our
prehistoric ancestors’ need for the support of a strong
group. Small groups of hunter-gatherers depended for
survival on their members’ strengths. It is
counterproductive to outcompete rivals within one’s
group to the point where one can no longer depend
on them in contests with other groups. But this
hypothesis at best explains why proposers offer large
amounts, not why responders reject low offers.
A more compelling explanation is that our
emotional apparatus has been shaped by millions of
years of living in small groups, where it is hard to
keep secrets. Our emotions are therefore not finely
tuned to one-time, strictly anonymous interactions. In
real life we expect our friends and neighbors to
notice our decisions. If people know that someone is
content with a small share, they are likely to make
that person low offers. But if someone is known to
angrily reject low offers, others have an incentive to
make that person high offers. Consequently, evolution
should have favored angry responses to low offers; if
one regularly receives fair offers when food is
divided, one is more likely to survive. Because oneshot interactions were rare during human evolution,
our emotions do not discriminate between one-shot
and repeated interactions. Therefore, we respond
emotionally to low offers in the Ultimatum Game
because we instinctively feel the need to reject dismal
offers in order to keep our self-esteem. This
self-esteem helps us to acquire a reputation that is
beneficial in future encounters.

23. Which one of the following most accurately
summarizes the main idea of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Contrary to a traditional assumption of
theoretical economics, the behavior of
participants in the Ultimatum Game
demonstrates that people do not make
economic decisions out of rational
self-interest.
Although the reactions most commonly
displayed by participants in the Ultimatum
Game appear to conflict with rational
self-interest, they probably result from a
predisposition that had evolutionary value.
Because our emotional apparatus has been
shaped by millions of years of living in small
groups in which it is hard to keep secrets, our
emotions are not finely tuned to one-shot,
anonymous interactions.
People respond emotionally to low offers in the
Ultimatum Game because they instinctively
feel the need to maintain the strength of the
social group to which they belong.
When certain social and evolutionary factors
are taken into account, it can be seen that the
behavior of participants in the Ultimatum
Game is motivated primarily by the need to
outcompete rivals.

24. The passage implies that the Ultimatum Game is
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

one that requires two strangers to develop trust
in each other
responsible for overturning a basic assumption
of theoretical economics
a situation that elicits unpredictable results
a type of one-shot, anonymous interaction
proof that our emotional apparatus has been
shaped by millions of years of living in small
groups

survey existing interpretations of the puzzling
results of an experiment
show how two theories that attempt to explain
the puzzling results of an experiment

26. Which one of the following sentences would most
logically conclude the final paragraph of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Contrary to the assumptions of theoretical
economics, human beings do not act primarily
out of self-interest.
Unfortunately, one-time, anonymous interactions
are becoming increasingly common in
contemporary society.
The instinctive urge to acquire a favorable
reputation may also help to explain the desire
of many proposers in the Ultimatum Game to
make “fair” offers.
High self-esteem and a positive reputation offer
individuals living in small groups many other
benefits as well.
The behavior of participants in the Ultimatum
Game sheds light on the question of what
constitutes a “fair” division.

27. In the context of the passage, the author would be most
likely to consider the explanation in the third paragraph
more favorably if it were shown that
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

our prehistoric ancestors often belonged to large
groups of more than a hundred people
in many prehistoric cultures, there were
hierarchies within groups that dictated which
allocations of goods were to be considered fair
and which were not
it is just as difficult to keep secrets in relatively
large social groups as it is in small social
groups
it is just as counterproductive to a small social
group to allow oneself to be outcompeted by
one’s rivals within the group as it is to
outcompete those rivals
in many social groups, there is a mutual
understanding among the group’s members that
allocations of goods will be based on
individual needs as opposed to equal shares
