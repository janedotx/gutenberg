SECTION I
Time—35 minutes
26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Commentator: Although the present freshwater supply is
adequate for today’s patterns of water use, the
human population will increase substantially over
the next few decades, drastically increasing the
need for freshwater. Hence, restrictions on water
use will be necessary to meet the freshwater needs
of humankind in the not-too-distant future.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Humans will adapt to restrictions on the use of
water without resorting to wasteful use of other
natural resources.
The total supply of freshwater has not diminished
in recent years.
The freshwater supply will not increase
sufficiently to meet the increased needs of
humankind.
No attempt to synthesize water will have an
appreciable effect on the quantity of freshwater
available.
No water conservation measure previously
attempted yielded an increase in the supply of
freshwater available for human use.

2. Psychologist: The best way to recall a certain word or
name that one is having trouble remembering is to
occupy one’s mind with other things, since often
the more we strive to remember a certain word or
name that we can’t think of, the less likely it
becomes that the word will come to mind.
The principle that underlies the psychologist’s argument
underlies which one of the following arguments?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Often, the best way to achieve happiness is to
pursue other things besides wealth and fame,
for there are wealthy and famous people who
are not particularly happy, which suggests that
true happiness does not consist in wealth and
fame.
The best way to succeed in writing a long
document is not to think about how much is
left to write but only about the current
paragraph, since on many occasions thinking
about what remains to be done will be so
discouraging that the writer will be tempted to
abandon the project.
The best way to overcome a serious mistake is
to continue on confidently as though all is
well. After all, one can overcome a serious
mistake by succeeding in new challenges, and
dwelling on one’s errors usually distracts one’s
mind from new challenges.
The best way to fall asleep quickly is to engage
in some mental diversion like counting sheep,
because frequently the more one concentrates
on falling asleep the lower the chance of
falling asleep quickly.
The best way to cope with sorrow or grief is to
turn one’s attention to those who are
experiencing even greater hardship, for in
many circumstances this will make our own
troubles seem bearable by comparison.

3. Letter to the editor: The Planning Department budget
increased from $100,000 in 2001 to $524,000 for
this year. However, this does not justify your
conclusion in yesterday’s editorial that the
department now spends five times as much money
as it did in 2001 to perform the same duties.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
support the claim made in the letter regarding the
justification of the editorial’s conclusion?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Departments other than the Planning
Department have had much larger budget
increases since 2001.
Since 2001, the Planning Department has
dramatically reduced its spending on overtime
pay.
In some years between 2001 and this year, the
Planning Department budget did not increase.
The budget figures used in the original editorial
were adjusted for inflation.
A restructuring act, passed in 2003, broadened
the duties of the Planning Department.

4. At mock trials in which jury instructions were given in
technical legal jargon, jury verdicts tended to mirror the
judge’s own opinions. Jurors had become aware of the
judge’s nonverbal behavior: facial expressions, body
movements, tone of voice. Jurors who viewed the same
case but were given instruction in clear, nontechnical
language, however, were comparatively more likely to
return verdicts at odds with the judge’s opinion.
Which one of the following is best illustrated by the
example described above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Technical language tends to be more precise
than nontechnical language.
A person’s influence is proportional to that
person’s perceived status.
Nonverbal behavior is not an effective means of
communication.
Real trials are better suited for experimentation
than are mock trials.
The way in which a judge instructs a jury can
influence the jury’s verdict.

5. Doctor: While a few alternative medicines have
dangerous side effects, some, such as many herbs,
have been proven safe to consume. Thus, though
there is little firm evidence of medicinal effect,
advocates of these herbs as remedies for serious
illnesses should always be allowed to prescribe
them, since their patients will not be harmed, and
might be helped, by the use of these products.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the doctor’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Many practitioners and patients neglect more
effective conventional medicines in favor of
herbal remedies.
Many herbal remedies are marketed with claims
of proven effectiveness when in fact their
effectiveness is unproven.
Some patients may have allergic reactions to
certain medicines that have been tolerated by
other patients.
The vast majority of purveyors of alternative
medicines are driven as much by the profit
motive as by a regard for their patients’ health.
Any pain relief or other benefits of many herbs
have been proven to derive entirely from
patients’ belief in the remedy, rather than from
its biochemical properties.

6. When a nation is on the brink of financial crisis, its
government does not violate free-market principles if, in
order to prevent economic collapse, it limits the extent
to which foreign investors and lenders can withdraw
their money. After all, the right to free speech does not
include the right to shout “Fire!” in a crowded theatre,
and the harm done as investors and lenders rush madly
to get their money out before everyone else does can be
just as real as the harm resulting from a stampede in a
theatre.
The argument does which one of the following?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

tries to show that a set of principles is limited
in a specific way by using an analogy to a
similar principle that is limited in a similar way
infers a claim by arguing that the truth of that
claim would best explain observed facts
presents numerous experimental results as
evidence for a general principle
attempts to demonstrate that an explanation of a
phenomenon is flawed by showing that it fails
to explain a particular instance of that
phenomenon
applies an empirical generalization to reach a
conclusion about a particular case

7. Although many political candidates object to being made
the target of advertising designed to cast them in an
adverse light, such advertising actually benefits its targets
because most elections have been won by candidates
who were the targets of that kind of advertising.
The pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument most
closely parallels that in which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Although many people dislike physical exercise,
they should exercise because it is a good way
to improve their overall health.
Although many actors dislike harsh reviews of
their work, such reviews actually help their
careers because most of the really prestigious
acting awards have gone to actors who have
had performances of theirs reviewed harshly.
Although many students dislike studying, it
must be a good way to achieve academic
success because most students who study pass
their courses.
Although many film critics dislike horror films,
such films are bound to be successful because
a large number of people are eager to attend them.
Although many people dislike feeling sleepy as
a result of staying up late the previous night,
such sleepiness must be acceptable to those
who experience it because most people who
stay up late enjoy doing so.

8. Working residents of Springfield live, on average,
farther from their workplaces than do working residents
of Rorchester. Thus, one would expect that the demand
for public transportation would be greater in Springfield
than in Rorchester. However, Springfield has only half
as many bus routes as Rorchester.
Each of the following, if true, contributes to a resolution
of the apparent discrepancy described above EXCEPT:
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Three-fourths of the Springfield workforce is
employed at the same factory outside the city
limits.
The average number of cars per household is
higher in Springfield than in Rorchester.
Rorchester has fewer railway lines than
Springfield.
Buses in Springfield run more frequently and on
longer routes than in Rorchester.
Springfield has a larger population than
Rorchester does.

9. People who need to reduce their intake of fat and to
consume fewer calories often turn to fat substitutes,
especially those with zero calories such as N5. But
studies indicate that N5 is of no use to such people.
Subjects who ate foods prepared with N5 almost
invariably reported feeling hungrier afterwards than after
eating foods prepared with real fat and consequently
they ate more, quickly making up for the calories
initially saved by using N5.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument fails to
consider the possibility that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

many foods cannot be prepared with N5
N5 has mild but unpleasant side effects
not everyone who eats foods prepared with N5
pays attention to caloric intake
people who know N5 contains zero calories
tend to eat more foods prepared with N5 than
do people who are unaware that N5 is
calorie-free
the total fat intake of people who eat foods
prepared with N5 tends to decrease even if
their caloric intake does not

10. Music historian: Some critics lament the fact that
impoverished postwar recording studios forced
early bebop musicians to record extremely short
solos, thus leaving a misleading record of their
music. But these musicians’ beautifully concise
playing makes the recordings superb artistic
works instead of mere representations of their live
solos. Furthermore, the conciseness characteristic
of early bebop musicians’ recordings fostered a
compactness in their subsequent live playing,
which the playing of the next generation lacks.
The music historian’s statements, if true, most strongly
support which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Representations of live solos generally are not
valuable artistic works.
The difficult postwar recording conditions had
some beneficial consequences for bebop.
Short bebop recordings are always superior to
longer ones.
The music of the generation immediately
following early bebop is of lower overall
quality than early bebop.
Musicians will not record extremely short solos
unless difficult recording conditions force them
to do so.

11. Recent studies indicate a correlation between damage to
human chromosome number six and adult schizophrenia.
We know, however, that there are people without damage
to this chromosome who develop adult schizophrenia
and that some people with damage to chromosome
number six do not develop adult schizophrenia. So there
is no causal connection between damage to human
chromosome number six and adult schizophrenia.
Which one of the following most accurately describes a
reasoning flaw in the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

The argument ignores the possibility that some
but not all types of damage to chromosome
number six lead to schizophrenia.
The argument presumes, without providing
evidence, that schizophrenia is caused solely
by chromosomal damage.
The argument makes a generalization based on
an unrepresentative sample population.
The argument mistakes a cause for an effect.
The argument presumes, without providing
warrant, that correlation implies causation.

12. City councilperson: Many city residents oppose the city
art commission’s proposed purchase of an unusual
stone edifice, on the grounds that art critics are
divided over whether the edifice really qualifies
as art. But I argue that the purpose of art is to
cause experts to debate ideas, including ideas
about what constitutes art itself. Since the edifice
has caused experts to debate what constitutes art
itself, it does qualify as art.
Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the
conclusion of the city councilperson’s argument to be
properly inferred?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Nothing qualifies as art unless it causes debate
among experts.
If an object causes debate among experts, no
expert can be certain whether that object
qualifies as art.
The purchase of an object that fulfills the
purpose of art should not be opposed.
Any object that fulfills the purpose of art
qualifies as art.
The city art commission should purchase the
edifice if it qualifies as art.

13. It is a given that to be an intriguing person, one must be
able to inspire the perpetual curiosity of others.
Constantly broadening one’s abilities and extending
one’s intellectual reach will enable one to inspire that
curiosity. For such a perpetual expansion of one’s mind
makes it impossible to be fully comprehended, making
one a constant mystery to others.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn in the argument above?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

To be an intriguing person, one must be able to
inspire the perpetual curiosity of others.
If one constantly broadens one’s abilities and
extends one’s intellectual reach, one will be
able to inspire the perpetual curiosity of others.
If one’s mind becomes impossible to fully
comprehend, one will always be a mystery to
others.
To inspire the perpetual curiosity of others, one
must constantly broaden one’s abilities and
extend one’s intellectual reach.
If one constantly broadens one’s abilities and
extends one’s intellectual reach, one will
always have curiosity.

14. Theater managers will not rent a film if they do not
believe it will generate enough total revenue—including
food-and-beverage concession revenue—to yield a
profit. Therefore, since film producers want their films
to be shown as widely as possible, they tend to make
films that theater managers consider attractive to
younger audiences.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Adults consume less of the sort of foods and
beverages sold at movie concession stands than
do either children or adolescents.
Movies of the kinds that appeal to younger
audiences almost never also appeal to older
audiences.
Food-and-beverage concession stands in movie
theaters are usually more profitable than the
movies that are shown.
Theater managers generally believe that a film
that is attractive to younger audiences is more
likely to be profitable than other films.
Films that have an appeal to older audiences
almost never generate a profit for theaters that
show them.

15. Almost all advances in genetic research give rise to
ethical dilemmas. Government is the exclusive source of
funding for most genetic research; those projects not
funded by government are funded solely by corporations.
One or the other of these sources of funding is necessary
for any genetic research.
If all the statements above are true, then which one of
the following must be true?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Most advances in genetic research occur in
projects funded by government rather than by
corporations.
Most genetic research funded by government
results in advances that give rise to ethical
dilemmas.
At least some advances in genetic research
occur in projects funded by corporations.
No ethical dilemmas resulting from advances in
genetic research arise without government or
corporate funding.
As long as government continues to fund
genetic research, that research will give rise to
ethical dilemmas.

16. Corporate businesses, like species, must adapt to
survive. Businesses that are no longer efficient will
become extinct. But sometimes a business cannot adapt
without changing its core corporate philosophy. Hence,
sometimes a business can survive only by becoming a
different corporation.

17. A survey taken ten years ago of residents of area L
showed that although living conditions were slightly
below their country’s average, most residents of L
reported general satisfaction with their living conditions.
However, this year the same survey found that while
living conditions are now about the same as the national
average, most residents of L report general
dissatisfaction with their living conditions.
Which one of the following, if true, would most help to
resolve the apparent conflict between the results of the
surveys described above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Residents of area L typically value aspects of
living conditions different from the aspects of
living conditions that are valued by residents
of adjacent areas.
Between the times that the two surveys were
conducted, the average living conditions in L’s
country had substantially declined.
Optimal living conditions were established in
the survey by taking into account governmental
policies and public demands on three continents.
Living conditions in an area generally improve
only if residents perceive their situation as
somehow in need of improvement.
Ten years ago the residents of area L were not
aware that their living conditions were below
the national average.

Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

No business can survive without changing its
core corporate philosophy.
As a business becomes less efficient, it
invariably surrenders its core corporate
philosophy.
Different corporations have different core
corporate philosophies.
If a business keeps its core corporate
philosophy intact, it will continue to exist.
A business cannot change its core corporate
philosophy without becoming a different
corporation.

18. Travel agent: Although most low-fare airlines have had
few, if any, accidents, very few such airlines have
been in existence long enough for their safety
records to be reliably established. Major airlines,
on the other hand, usually have long-standing
records reliably indicating their degree of safety.
Hence, passengers are safer on a major airline
than on one of the newer low-fare airlines.
Of the following, which one is the criticism to which
the reasoning in the travel agent’s argument is most
vulnerable?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The argument fails to address adequately the
possibility that the average major airline has
had a total number of accidents as great as the
average low-fare airline has had.
The argument draws a general conclusion about
how safe passengers are on different airlines
on the basis of safety records that are each
from too brief a period to adequately justify
such a conclusion.
The argument fails to consider the possibility
that long-standing and reliable records
documenting an airline’s degree of safety may
indicate that the airline is unsafe.
The argument takes for granted that airlines that
are the safest are also the most reliable in
documenting their safety.
The argument fails to address adequately the
possibility that even airlines with
long-standing, reliable records indicating their
degree of safety are still likely to have one or
more accidents.

19. Economist: Our economy’s weakness is the direct result
of consumers’ continued reluctance to spend,
which in turn is caused by factors such as
high-priced goods and services. This reluctance is
exacerbated by the fact that the average income is
significantly lower than it was five years ago.
Thus, even though it is not a perfect solution, if
the government were to lower income taxes, the
economy would improve.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the economist’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Increasing consumer spending will cause prices
for goods and services to decrease.
If consumer spending increases, the average
income will increase.
If income taxes are not lowered, consumers’
wages will decline even further.
Consumers will be less reluctant to spend
money if income taxes are lowered.
Lowering income taxes will have no effect on
government spending.

20. A person with a type B lipid profile is at much greater
risk of heart disease than a person with a type A lipid
profile. In an experiment, both type A volunteers and
type B volunteers were put on a low-fat diet. The
cholesterol levels of the type B volunteers soon dropped
substantially, although their lipid profiles were
unchanged. The type A volunteers, however, showed no
benefit from the diet, and 40 percent of them actually
shifted to type B profiles.
If the information above is true, which one of the
following must also be true?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In the experiment, most of the volunteers had
their risk of heart disease reduced at least
marginally as a result of having been put on
the diet.
People with type B lipid profiles have higher
cholesterol levels, on average, than do people
with type A lipid profiles.
Apart from adopting the low-fat diet, most of
the volunteers did not substantially change any
aspect of their lifestyle that would have
affected their cholesterol levels or lipid profiles.
The reduction in cholesterol levels in the
volunteers is solely responsible for the change
in their lipid profiles.
For at least some of the volunteers in the
experiment, the risk of heart disease increased
after having been put on the low-fat diet.

21. Columnist: Although there is and should be complete
freedom of thought and expression, that does not
mean that there is nothing wrong with exploiting
depraved popular tastes for the sake of financial gain.
Which one of the following judgments conforms most
closely to the principle cited by the columnist?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The government should grant artists the right to
create whatever works of art they want to
create so long as no one considers those works
to be depraved.
People who produce depraved movies have the
freedom to do so, but that means that they also
have the freedom to refrain from doing so.
There should be no laws restricting what books
are published, but publishing books that pander
to people with depraved tastes is not thereby
morally acceptable.
The public has the freedom to purchase
whatever recordings are produced, but that
does not mean that the government may not
limit the production of recordings deemed to
be depraved.
One who advocates complete freedom of speech
should not criticize others for saying things
that he or she believes to exhibit depraved
tastes.

22. When a society undergoes slow change, its younger
members find great value in the advice of its older
members. But when a society undergoes rapid change,
young people think that little in the experience of their
elders is relevant to them, and so do not value their
advice. Thus, we may measure the rate at which a
society is changing by measuring the amount of
deference its younger members show to their elders.

23. Politician: We should impose a tariff on imported fruit
to make it cost consumers more than domestic
fruit. Otherwise, growers from other countries
who can grow better fruit more cheaply will put
domestic fruit growers out of business. This will
result in farmland’s being converted to more
lucrative industrial uses and the consequent
vanishing of a unique way of life.
The politician’s recommendation most closely conforms
to which one of the following principles?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

24. The Kiffer Forest Preserve, in the northernmost part of
the Abbimac Valley, is where most of the bears in the
valley reside. During the eight years that the main road
through the preserve has been closed the preserve’s bear
population has nearly doubled. Thus, the valley’s bear
population will increase if the road is kept closed.
Which one of the following, if true, most undermines
the argument?
(A)

(B)

Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A society’s younger members can often
accurately discern whether that society is
changing rapidly.
How much deference young people show to
their elders depends on how much of the
elders’ experience is practically useful to them.
The deference young people show to their
elders varies according to how much the young
value their elders’ advice.
The faster a society changes, the less relevant
the experience of older members of the society
is to younger members.
Young people value their elders’ advice just
insofar as the elders’ experience is practically
useful to them.

A country should put its own economic interest
over that of other countries.
The interests of producers should always take
precedence over those of consumers.
Social concerns should sometimes take
precedence over economic efficiency.
A country should put the interests of its own
citizens ahead of those of citizens of other
countries.
Government intervention sometimes creates
more economic efficiency than free markets.

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most of the increase in the preserve’s bear
population over the past eight years is due to
migration.
Only some of the increase in the preserve’s bear
population over the past eight years is due to
migration of bears from other parts of the
Abbimac Valley.
Only some of the increase in the preserve’s bear
population over the past eight years is due to
migration of bears from outside the Abbimac
Valley.
The bear population in areas of the Abbimac
Valley outside the Kiffer Forest Preserve has
decreased over the past eight years.
The bear population in the Abbimac Valley has
remained about the same over the past eight
years.

25. If a wig has any handmade components, it is more
expensive than one with none. Similarly, a
made-to-measure wig ranges from medium-priced to
expensive. Handmade foundations are never found on
wigs that do not use human hair. Furthermore, any wig
that contains human hair should be dry-cleaned. So all
made-to-measure wigs should be dry-cleaned.
The conclusion of the argument follows logically if
which one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Any wig whose price falls in the medium-priced
to expensive range has a handmade foundation.
If a wig’s foundation is handmade, then it is
more expensive than one whose foundation is
not handmade.
A wig that has any handmade components
should be dry-cleaned.
If a wig’s foundation is handmade, then its
price is at least in the medium range.
Any wig that should be dry-cleaned has a
foundation that is handmade.

26. Philosopher: Wolves do not tolerate an attack by one
wolf on another if the latter wolf demonstrates
submission by baring its throat. The same is true
of foxes and domesticated dogs. So it would be
erroneous to deny that animals have rights on the
grounds that only human beings are capable of
obeying moral rules.
The philosopher’s argument proceeds by attempting to
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

provide counterexamples to refute a premise on
which a particular conclusion is based
establish inductively that all animals possess
some form of morality
cast doubt on the principle that being capable of
obeying moral rules is a necessary condition
for having rights
establish a claim by showing that the denial of
that claim entails a logical contradiction
provide evidence suggesting that the concept of
morality is often applied too broadly

Traditional sources of evidence about ancient
history are archaeological remains and surviving texts.
Those investigating the crafts practiced by women in
ancient times, however, often derive little information
from these sources, and the archaeological record is
particularly unavailing for the study of ancient textile
production, as researchers are thwarted by the
perishable nature of cloth. What shreds persisted
through millennia were, until recently, often discarded
by excavators as useless, as were loom weights, which
appeared to be nothing more than blobs of clay.
Ancient texts, meanwhile, rarely mention the creation
of textiles; moreover, those references that do exist use
archaic, unrevealing terminology. Yet despite these
obstacles, researchers have learned a great deal about
ancient textiles and those who made them, and also
about how to piece together a whole picture from many
disparate sources of evidence.
Technological advances in the analysis of
archaeological remains provide much more information
than was previously available, especially about minute
remains. Successful modern methods include
radiocarbon dating, infrared photography for seeing
through dirt without removing it, isotope
“fingerprinting” for tracing sources of raw materials,
and thin-layer chromatography for analyzing dyes. As
if in preparation for such advances, the field of
archaeology has also undergone an important
philosophical revolution in the past century. Once little
more than a self-serving quest for artifacts to stock
museums and private collections, the field has
transformed itself into a scientific pursuit of knowledge
about past cultures. As part of this process,
archaeologists adopted the fundamental precept of
preserving all objects, even those that have no
immediately discernible value. Thus in the 1970s two
researchers found the oldest known complete garment,
a 5,000-year-old linen shirt, among a tumbled heap of
dirty linens that had been preserved as part of the wellknown Petrie collection decades before anyone began
to study the history of textiles.
The history of textiles and of the craftswomen who
produced them has also advanced on a different front:
recreating the actual production of cloth.
Reconstructing and implementing ancient production
methods provides a valuable way of generating and
checking hypotheses. For example, these techniques
made it possible to confirm that the excavated pieces of
clay once considered useless in fact functioned as loom
weights. Similarly, scholars have until recently been

(55)

(60)

obliged to speculate as to which one of two statues of
Athena, one large and one small, was adorned with a
dress created by a group of Athenian women for a
festival, as described in surviving texts. Because
records show that it took nine months to produce the
dress, scholars assumed it must have adorned the large
statue. But by investigating the methods of production
and the size of the looms used, researchers have

(C)

(D)

(E)

Archaeology is an expanding discipline that has
transformed itself in response both to scientific
advances and to changing cultural demands such
as a recently increasing interest in women’s
history.
A diversity of new approaches to the study of
ancient textiles has enabled researchers to infer
much about the history of textiles and their
creators in the ancient world from the scant
evidence that remains.
Despite many obstacles, research into the textile
production methods used by women in the
ancient world has advanced over the past
century to the point that archaeologists can now
replicate ancient equipment and production
techniques.
Research into the history of textiles has spurred
sweeping changes in the field of archaeology,
from the application of advanced technology to
the revaluation of ancient artifacts that were
once deemed useless.
Though researchers have verified certain theories
about the history of textiles by using
technological developments such as radiocarbon
dating, most significant findings in this field
have grown out of the reconstruction of ancient
production techniques.

The success that Nigerian-born computer scientist
Philip Emeagwali (b. 1954) has had in designing
computers that solve real-world problems has been
fueled by his willingness to reach beyond established
paradigms and draw inspiration for his designs from
nature. In the 1980s, Emeagwali achieved
breakthroughs in the design of parallel computer
systems. Whereas single computers work sequentially,
making one calculation at a time, computers
connected in parallel can process calculations
simultaneously. In 1989, Emeagwali pioneered the use
of massively parallel computers that used a network
of thousands of smaller computers to solve what is
considered one of the most computationally difficult
problems: predicting the flow of oil through the
subterranean geologic formations that make up oil
fields. Until that time, supercomputers had been used
for oil field calculations, but because these
supercomputers worked sequentially, they were too
slow and inefficient to accurately predict such
extremely complex movements.
To model oil field flow using a computer requires
the simulation of the distribution of the oil at tens of
thousands of locations throughout the field. At each
location, hundreds of simultaneous calculations must
be made at regular time intervals relating to such
variables as temperature, direction of oil flow,
viscosity, and pressure, as well as geologic properties
of the basin holding the oil. In order to solve this
problem, Emeagwali designed a massively parallel
computer by using the Internet to connect to more
than 65,000 smaller computers. One of the great
difficulties of parallel computing is dividing up the
tasks among the separate smaller computers so that
they do not interfere with each other, and it was here
that Emeagwali turned to natural processes for ideas,
noting that tree species that survive today are those
that, over the course of hundreds of millions of years,
have developed branching patterns that have
maximized the amount of sunlight gathered and the
quantity of water and sap delivered. Emeagwali
demonstrated that, for modeling certain phenomena
such as subterranean oil flow, a network design based
on the mathematical principle that underlies the
branching structures of trees will enable a massively
parallel computer to gather and broadcast the largest
quantity of messages to its processing points in the
shortest time.
In 1996 Emeagwali had another breakthrough
when he presented the design for a massively parallel
computer that he claims will be powerful enough to
predict global weather patterns a century in advance.
The computer’s design is based on the geometry of
bees’ honeycombs, which use an extremely efficient

2

(55)

(60)

three-dimensional spacing. Emeagwali believes that
computer scientists in the future will increasingly
look to nature for elegant solutions to complex
technical problems. This paradigm shift, he asserts,
will enable us to better understand the systems
evolved by nature and, thereby, to facilitate the
evolution of human technology.

8. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Emeagwali’s establishment of new
computational paradigms has enabled parallel
computer systems to solve a wide array of
real-world problems that supercomputers
cannot solve.
Emeagwali has shown that scientists’ allegiance
to established paradigms has until now
prevented the solution of many real-world
computational problems that could otherwise
have been solved with little difficulty.
Emeagwali’s discovery of the basic
mathematical principles underlying natural
systems has led to a growing use of parallel
computer systems to solve complex real-world
computational problems.
Emeagwali has designed parallel computer
systems that are modeled on natural systems
and that are aimed at solving real-world
computational problems that would be difficult
to solve with more traditional designs.
The paradigm shift initiated by Emeagwali’s
computer designs has made it more likely that
scientists will in the future look to systems
evolved by nature to facilitate the evolution of
human technology.

Emeagwali’s breakthroughs in computer design
have begun to make computers that work

Emeagwali’s first breakthrough in computer
design came in response to a request by an oil
company.

Until recently, computer scientists have had
very limited awareness of many of the
mathematical principles that have been shown
to underlie a wide variety of natural processes.
Some of the variables affecting global weather
patterns have yet to be discovered by scientists
who study these patterns.
Computer designs for the prediction of natural
phenomena tend to be more successful when
those phenomena are not affected by human
activities.
Some of the mathematical principles underlying
Emeagwali’s model of oil field flow also
underlie his designs for other massively
parallel computer systems.
Underlying the designs for many traditional
technologies are mathematical principles of

Proponents of the tangible-object theory of
copyright argue that copyright and similar intellectualproperty rights can be explained as logical extensions
of the right to own concrete, tangible objects. This
view depends on the claim that every copyrightable
work can be manifested in some physical form, such as
a manuscript or a videotape. It also accepts the premise
that ownership of an object confers a number of rights
on the owner, who may essentially do whatever he or
she pleases with the object to the extent that this does
not violate other people’s rights. One may, for
example, hide or display the object, copy it, or destroy
it. One may also transfer ownership of it to another.
In creating a new and original object from
materials that one owns, one becomes the owner of that
object and thereby acquires all of the rights that
ownership entails. But if the owner transfers ownership
of the object, the full complement of rights is not
necessarily transferred to the new owner; instead, the
original owner may retain one or more of these rights.
This notion of retained rights is common in many areas
of law; for example, the seller of a piece of land may
retain certain rights to the land in the form of
easements or building restrictions. Applying the notion
of retained rights to the domain of intellectual property,
theorists argue that copyrighting a work secures official
recognition of one’s intention to retain certain rights to
that work. Among the rights typically retained by the
original producer of an object such as a literary
manuscript or a musical score would be the right to
copy the object for profit and the right to use it as a
guide for the production of similar or analogous
things—for example, a public performance of a
musical score.
According to proponents of the tangible-object
theory, its chief advantage is that it justifies intellectual
property rights without recourse to the widely accepted
but problematic supposition that one can own abstract,
intangible things such as ideas. But while this account
seems plausible for copyrightable entities that do, in
fact, have enduring tangible forms, it cannot
accommodate the standard assumption that such
evanescent things as live broadcasts of sporting events
can be copyrighted. More importantly, it does not
acknowledge that in many cases the work of
conceiving ideas is more crucial and more valuable
than that of putting them into tangible form. Suppose
that a poet dictates a new poem to a friend, who writes
it down on paper that the friend has supplied. The
creator of the tangible object in this case is not the poet
but the friend, and there would seem to be no ground
for the poet’s claiming copyright unless the poet can be said
to already own the ideas expressed in the work.

the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(E)

Copyright and other intellectual-property rights
can be explained as logical extensions of the
right to own concrete objects.
Attempts to explain copyright and similar
intellectual-property rights purely in terms of
rights to ownership of physical objects are
ultimately misguided.
Copyrighting a work amounts to securing official
recognition of one’s intention to retain certain
rights to that work.
Explanations of copyright and other intellectualproperty rights in terms of rights to ownership of
tangible objects fail to consider the argument
that ideas should be allowed to circulate freely.
Under the tangible-object theory of intellectual
property, rights of ownership are straightforwardly
applicable to both ideas and physical objects.

15. According to the passage, the theory that copyright and
other intellectual-property rights can be construed as
logical extensions of the right to own concrete, tangible
objects depends on the claim that

any work entitled to intellectual-property
protection can be expressed in physical form
only the original creator of an intellectual work
can hold the copyright for that work
the work of putting ideas into tangible form is
more crucial and more valuable than the work of
conceiving those ideas
in a few cases, it is necessary to recognize the
right to own abstract, intangible things
the owner of an item of intellectual property may
legally destroy it

Has the tangible-object theory of intellectual
property influenced the ways in which copyright
cases or other cases involving issues of
intellectual property are decided in the courts?

Most legal systems explicitly rely on the tangibleobject theory of intellectual property in order to
avoid asserting that one can own abstract things.
Copyright protects the right to copy for profit, but
not the right to copy for other reasons.
Some works deserving of copyright protection
simply cannot be manifested as concrete,
tangible objects.

need not invoke the notion of inventors’
ownership of abstract ideas.

In most transactions involving the transfer of
non-intellectual property, at least some rights
of ownership are retained by the seller.
The notion of retained rights of ownership is
currently applied to only those areas of law that
do not involve intellectual property.
The idea that ownership of the right to copy an
item for profit can be transferred is compatible
with a tangible-object theory of intellectual
property.
Ownership of intellectual property is sufficiently
protected by the provisions that, under many
legal systems, apply to ownership of material
things such as land.
Protection of computer programs under
intellectual-property law is justifiable only if the
programs are likely to be used as a guide for the
production of similar or analogous programs.

20. It can be inferred that the author of the passage is most
likely to believe which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Theorists who suggest that the notion of retained
rights is applicable to intellectual property do
not fully understand what it means to transfer
ownership of property.
If a work does not exist in a concrete, tangible
form, there is no valid theoretical basis for
claiming that it should have copyright
protection.
Under existing statutes, creators of original
tangible works that have intellectual or artistic
significance generally do not have the legal right
to own the abstract ideas embodied in those
works.
An adequate theoretical justification of copyright
would likely presuppose that a work’s creator
originally owns the ideas embodied in that work.
It is common, but incorrect, to assume that such
evanescent things as live broadcasts of sporting
events can be copyrighted.

Passage A
In music, a certain complexity of sounds can be
expected to have a positive effect on the listener. A
single, pure tone is not that interesting to explore; a
measure of intricacy is required to excite human
curiosity. Sounds that are too complex or disorganized,
however, tend to be overwhelming. We prefer some
sort of coherence, a principle that connects the various
sounds and makes them comprehensible.
In this respect, music is like human language.
Single sounds are in most cases not sufficient to
convey meaning in speech, whereas when put together
in a sequence they form words and sentences.
Likewise, if the tones in music are not perceived to be
tied together sequentially or rhythmically—for
example, in what is commonly called melody—
listeners are less likely to feel any emotional
connection or to show appreciation.
Certain music can also have a relaxing effect. The
fact that such music tends to be continuous and
rhythmical suggests a possible explanation for this
effect. In a natural environment, danger tends to be
accompanied by sudden, unexpected sounds. Thus, a
background of constant noise suggests peaceful
conditions; discontinuous sounds demand more
attention. Even soft discontinuous sounds that we
consciously realize do not signal danger can be
disturbing—for example, the erratic dripping of a
leaky tap. A continuous sound, particularly one that is
judged to be safe, relaxes the brain.
Passage B
There are certain elements within music, such
as a change of melodic line or rhythm, that create
expectations about the future development of the
music. The expectation the listener has about the
further course of musical events is a key determinant
for the experience of “musical emotions.” Music
creates expectations that, if not immediately satisfied,
create tension. Emotion is experienced in relation to
the buildup and release of tension. The more elaborate
the buildup of tension, the more intense the emotions
that will be experienced. When resolution occurs,
relaxation follows.
The interruption of the expected musical course,
depending on one’s personal involvement, causes the
search for an explanation. This results from a
“mismatch” between one’s musical expectation and the
actual course of the music. Negative emotions will be
the result of an extreme mismatch between
expectations and experience. Positive emotions result
if the converse happens.
When we listen to music, we take into account
factors such as the complexity and novelty of the
music. The degree to which the music sounds familiar
determines whether the music is experienced as
pleasurable or uncomfortable. The pleasure
experienced is minimal when the music is entirely new
to the listener, increases with increasing familiarity,
and decreases again when the music is totally known.

(60)

Musical preference is based on one’s desire to
maintain a constant level of certain preferable
emotions. As such, a trained listener will have a
greater preference for complex melodies than will a
naive listener, as the threshold for experiencing
emotion is higher.

The type of musical emotion experienced by a

If the development of a piece of music is
greatly at odds with the listener’s musical

negative emotions.
Listeners can learn to appreciate changes in
melodic line and other musical complexities.
Music that is experienced by listeners as

25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Automated flight technology can guide an aircraft very
reliably, from navigation to landing. Yet this technology,
even when functioning correctly, is not a perfect
safeguard against human error.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the situation described above?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Automated flight technology does not always
function correctly.
Smaller aircraft do not always have their
automated flight technology updated regularly.
If a plane’s automated flight technology
malfunctions, crew members have to operate
the plane manually.
Some airplane crashes are due neither to human
error nor to malfunction of automated flight
technology.
Automated flight technology invariably executes
exactly the commands that humans give it.

3. The reason music with a simple recurring rhythm exerts
a strong primordial appeal is that it reminds us of the
womb environment. After all, the first sound heard
within the womb is the comforting sound of the
mother’s regular heartbeat. So in taking away from us
the warmth and security of the womb, birth also takes
away a primal and constant source of comfort. Thus it is
extremely natural that in seeking sensations of warmth
and security throughout life, people would be strongly
drawn toward simple recurring rhythmic sounds.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion drawn in the reasoning above?
(A)

(B)

(C)
2. To keep one’s hands warm during the winter, one never
needs gloves or mittens. One can always keep one’s
hands warm simply by putting on an extra layer of
clothing, such as a thermal undershirt or a sweater. After
all, keeping one’s vital organs warm can keep one’s
hands warm as well.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Maintaining the temperature of your hands is
far less important, physiologically, than
maintaining the temperature of your torso.
Several layers of light garments will keep one’s
vital organs warmer than will one or two
heavy garments.
Wearing an extra layer of clothing will not keep
one’s hands warm at temperatures low enough
to cause frostbite.
Keeping one’s hands warm by putting on an
extra layer of clothing is less effective than
turning up the heat.
The physical effort required to put on an extra
layer of clothing does not stimulate circulation
enough to warm your hands.

(D)

(E)

The explanation of the strong primordial appeal
of music with a simple recurring rhythm is that
it reminds us of the womb environment.
The comforting sound of the mother’s regular
heartbeat is the first sound that is heard inside
the womb.
Birth deprives us of a primal and constant
source of comfort when it takes away the
warmth and security of the womb.
People seek sensations of warmth and security
throughout life because birth takes away the
warmth and security of the womb.
The comforting sound of the mother’s regular
heartbeat is a simple recurring rhythmic sound.

4. Linguist: Most people can tell whether a sequence of
words in their own dialect is grammatical. Yet
few people who can do so are able to specify the
relevant grammatical rules.

underlying the linguist’s statements?
(A)

(E)

Some people are able to write cogent and
accurate narrative descriptions of events. But
these people are not necessarily also capable of

poems.
Engineers who apply the principles of physics

6. Beginners typically decide each chess move by
considering the consequences. Expert players, in
contrast, primarily use pattern-recognition techniques.
That is, such a player recognizes having been in a
similar position before and makes a decision based on
information recalled about the consequences of moves
chosen on that prior occasion.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Beginning chess players are better at thinking
through the consequences of chess moves than
experts are.
A beginning chess player should use
pattern-recognition techniques when deciding
what move to make.
One’s chess skills will improve only if one
learns to use pattern-recognition techniques.
In playing chess, an expert player relies
crucially on his or her memory.
Any chess player who played other games that
require pattern-recognition skills would thereby
improve his or her chess skills.

7. Farmer: Because water content is what makes popcorn
pop, the kernels must dry at just the right speed to
trap the correct amount of water. The best way to
achieve this effect is to have the sun dry the corn
while the corn is still in the field, but I always dry
the ears on a screen in a warm, dry room.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent discrepancy between the farmer’s
theory and practice?
(A)

The company president’s reasoning is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that it
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The region in which the farmer grows popcorn
experiences a long, cloudy season that begins
shortly before the popcorn in fields would
begin to dry.
Leaving popcorn to dry on its stalks in the field
is the least expensive method of drying it.
Drying popcorn on its stalks in the field is only
one of several methods that allow the kernels’
water content to reach acceptable levels.
When popcorn does not dry sufficiently, it will
still pop, but it will take several minutes to do
so, even under optimal popping conditions.
If popcorn is allowed to dry too much, it will
not pop.

8. Factory manager: One reason the automobile parts this
factory produces are expensive is that our
manufacturing equipment is outdated and
inefficient. Our products would be more
competitively priced if we were to refurbish the
factory completely with new, more efficient
equipment. Therefore, since to survive in today’s
market we have to make our products more
competitively priced, we must completely
refurbish the factory in order to survive.

10. Nutritionists believe that a person’s daily requirement
for vitamins can readily be met by eating five servings
of fruits and vegetables daily. However, most people eat
far less than this. Thus, most people need to take
vitamin pills.

flawed because this argument

second thing may in fact be the cause of the
first

first considering any possible causes of that
problem

instead merely suggests that some possible
course of action might be effective

9. Two months ago a major shipment of pythons arrived
from Africa, resulting in a great number of inexpensive
pythons in pet stores. Anyone interested in buying a
python, however, should beware: many pythons hatched
in Africa are afflicted with a deadly liver disease.
Although a few pythons recently hatched in North
America have this disease, a much greater proportion of
African-hatched pythons have it. The disease is difficult
to detect in its early stages, and all pythons die within
six months of contracting the disease.
Which one of the following statements can be properly
inferred from the statements above?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Some pythons hatched in North America may
appear fine but will die within six months as a
result of the liver disease.
Pythons that hatch in Africa are more
susceptible to the liver disease than are
pythons that hatch in North America.
Any python that has not died by the age of six
months does not have the liver disease.
The pythons are inexpensively priced because
many of them suffer from the liver disease.
Pythons hatched in neither Africa nor North
America are not afflicted with the liver
disease.

(D)

(E)

Even five servings of fruits and vegetables a
day is insufficient unless the intake is varied to
ensure that different vitamins are consumed.
Certain commonly available fruits and vegetables
contain considerably more nutrients than others.
Nutritionists sometimes disagree on how much
of a fruit or vegetable constitutes a complete
serving.
Many commonly consumed foods that are
neither fruits nor vegetables are fortified by
manufacturers with the vitamins found in fruits
and vegetables.
Fruits and vegetables are also important sources
of fiber, in forms not found in vitamin pills.

11. Researcher: This fall I returned to a research site to
recover the armadillos I had tagged there the
previous spring. Since a large majority of the
armadillos I recaptured were found within a few
hundred yards of the location of their tagging last
spring, I concluded that armadillos do not move
rapidly into new territories.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the researcher’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Of the armadillos living in the area of the
tagging site last spring, few were able to avoid
being tagged by the researcher.
Most of the armadillos tagged the previous
spring were not recaptured during the
subsequent fall.
Predators did not kill any of the armadillos that
had been tagged the previous spring.
The tags identifying the armadillos cannot be
removed by the armadillos, either by accident
or deliberately.
A large majority of the recaptured armadillos
did not move to a new territory in the
intervening summer and then move back to the
old territory by the fall.

potential would have to produce work that would
gain widespread popular acclaim, instead of their
best work. That is why governments are justified

13. Adult frogs are vulnerable to dehydration because of
their highly permeable skins. Unlike large adult frogs,
small adult frogs have such a low ratio of body weight
to skin surface area that they cannot survive in arid
climates. The animals’ moisture requirements constitute
the most important factor determining where frogs can
live in the Yucatán peninsula, which has an arid climate
in the north and a wet climate in the south.
The information above most strongly supports which
one of the following conclusions about frogs in the
Yucatán peninsula?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Large adult frogs cannot coexist with small
adult frogs in the wet areas.
Frogs living in wet areas weigh more on
average than frogs in the arid areas.
Large adult frogs can live in more of the area
than small adult frogs can.
Fewer small adult frogs live in the south than
do large adult frogs.
Small adult frogs in the south have less permeable
skins than small adult frogs in the north.

14. Editorial: A recent survey shows that 77 percent of
people feel that crime is increasing and that
87 percent feel the judicial system should be handing
out tougher sentences. Therefore, the government
must firmly address the rising crime rate.

(C)

because they suggest that more people are
concerned about the sentencing of criminals
than are concerned about crime itself
presumes, without providing justification, that
there is a correlation between criminal offenders
being treated leniently and a high crime rate
fails to consider whether other surveys showing
different results have been conducted over the
years
fails to distinguish between the crime rate’s
actually rising and people’s believing that the
crime rate is rising
presumes, without providing justification, that
tougher sentences are the most effective means
of alleviating the crime problem

15. Proofs relying crucially on computers provide less
certainty than do proofs not requiring computers. Human
cognition alone cannot verify computer-dependent
proofs; such proofs can never provide the degree of
certainty that attends our judgments concerning, for
instance, simple arithmetical facts, which can be verified
by human calculation. Of course, in these cases one
often uses electronic calculators, but here the computer
is a convenience rather than a supplement to human
cognition.
The statements above, if true, most strongly support
which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Only if a proof’s result is arrived at without the
help of a computer can one judge with any
degree of certainty that the proof is correct.
We can never be completely sure that proofs
relying crucially on computers do not contain
errors that humans do not detect.
Whenever a computer replaces human
calculation in a proof, the degree of certainty
provided by the proof is reduced.
If one can corroborate something by human
calculation, one can be completely certain of it.
It is impossible to supplement the cognitive
abilities of humans by means of artificial
devices such as computers.

16. Madden: Industrialists address problems by simplifying
them, but in farming that strategy usually leads to
oversimplification. For example, industrialists see
water retention and drainage as different and
opposite functions—that good topsoil both drains
and retains water is a fact alien to industrial logic.
To facilitate water retention, they use a terrace or
a dam; to facilitate drainage, they use drain tile, a
ditch, or a subsoiler. More farming problems are
created than solved when agriculture is the
domain of the industrialist, not of the farmer.
The situation as Madden describes it best illustrates
which one of the following propositions?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The handling of water drainage and retention is
the most important part of good farming.
The problems of farming should be viewed in
all their complexity.
Farmers are better than anyone else at solving
farming problems.
Industrial solutions for problems in farming
should never be sought.
The approach to problem solving typical of
industrialists is fundamentally flawed.

17. Critic: Works of modern literature cannot be tragedies as
those of ancient playwrights and storytellers were
unless their protagonists are seen as possessing
nobility, which endures through the calamities
that befall one. In an age that no longer takes
seriously the belief that human endeavors are
governed by fate, it is therefore impossible for a
contemporary work of literature to be a tragedy.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the critic’s argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Whether or not a work of literature is a tragedy
should not depend on characteristics of its
audience.
The belief that human endeavors are governed
by fate is false.
Most plays that were once classified as tragedies
were misclassified.
Those whose endeavors are not regarded as
governed by fate will not be seen as
possessing nobility.
If an ignoble character in a work of literature
endures through a series of misfortunes, that
work of literature is not a tragedy.

18. Despite the efforts of a small minority of graduate
students at one university to unionize, the majority of
graduate students there remain unaware of the attempt.
Most of those who are aware believe that a union would
not represent their interests or that, if it did, it would not
effectively pursue them. Thus, the graduate students at
the university should not unionize, since the majority of
them obviously disapprove of the attempt.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

tries to establish a conclusion simply on the
premise that the conclusion agrees with a
long-standing practice
fails to exclude alternative explanations for why
some graduate students disapprove of unionizing
presumes that simply because a majority of a
population is unaware of something, it must
not be a good idea
ignores the possibility that although a union
might not effectively pursue graduate student
interests, there are other reasons for unionizing
blurs the distinction between active disapproval
and mere lack of approval

19. Anyone who believes in democracy has a high regard
for the wisdom of the masses. Griley, however, is an
elitist who believes that any artwork that is popular is
unlikely to be good. Thus, Griley does not believe in
democracy.
The conclusion follows logically if which one of the
following is assumed?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Anyone who believes that an artwork is
unlikely to be good if it is popular is an elitist.
Anyone who believes that if an artwork is
popular it is unlikely to be good does not have
a high regard for the wisdom of the masses.
If Griley is not an elitist, then he has a high
regard for the wisdom of the masses.
Anyone who does not have a high regard for
the wisdom of the masses is an elitist who
believes that if an artwork is popular it is
unlikely to be good.
Unless Griley believes in democracy, Griley
does not have a high regard for the wisdom of
the masses.

20. A recent study confirmed that salt intake tends to
increase blood pressure and found that, as a result,
people with high blood pressure who significantly cut
their salt intake during the study had lower blood
pressure by the end of the study. However, it was also
found that some people who had very high salt intake
both before and throughout the study maintained very
low blood pressure.

Which one of the following, if true, contributes the most
to an explanation of the results of the study?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Study participants with high blood pressure who
cut their salt intake only slightly during the
study did not have significantly lower blood
pressure by the end of the study.
Salt intake is only one of several dietary factors
associated with high blood pressure.
For most people who have high blood pressure,
reducing salt intake is not the most effective
dietary change they can make to reduce their
blood pressure.
At the beginning of the study, some people who
had very low salt intake also had very high
blood pressure.
Persons suffering from abnormally low blood
pressure have heightened salt cravings, which
ensure that their blood pressure does not drop
too low.

21. The odds of winning any major lottery jackpot are
extremely slight. However, the very few people who do
win major jackpots receive a great deal of attention
from the media. Thus, since most people come to have
at least some awareness of events that receive extensive
media coverage, it is likely that many people greatly
overestimate the odds of their winning a major jackpot.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most people who overestimate the likelihood of
winning a major jackpot do so at least in part
because media coverage of other people who
have won major jackpots downplays the odds
against winning such a jackpot.
Very few people other than those who win
major jackpots receive a great deal of attention
from the media.
If it were not for media attention, most people
who purchase lottery tickets would not
overestimate their chances of winning a jackpot.
Becoming aware of individuals who have won a
major jackpot leads at least some people to
incorrectly estimate their own chances of
winning such a jackpot.
At least some people who are heavily
influenced by the media do not believe that the
odds of their winning a major jackpot are
significant.

22. A book tour will be successful if it is well publicized
and the author is an established writer. Julia is an
established writer, and her book tour was successful. So
her book tour must have been well publicized.

Which one of the following exhibits a pattern of flawed
reasoning most closely parallel to the pattern of flawed
reasoning exhibited by the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

This recipe will turn out only if one follows it
exactly and uses high-quality ingredients.
Arthur followed the recipe exactly and it
turned out. Thus, Arthur must have used
high-quality ingredients.
If a computer has the fastest microprocessor and
the most memory available, it will meet
Aletha’s needs this year. This computer met
Aletha’s needs last year. So it must have had
the fastest microprocessor and the most
memory available last year.
If cacti are kept in the shade and watered more
than twice weekly, they will die. This cactus
was kept in the shade, and it is now dead.
Therefore, it must have been watered more
than twice weekly.
A house will suffer from dry rot and poor
drainage only if it is built near a high water
table. This house suffers from dry rot and has
poor drainage. Thus, it must have been built
near a high water table.
If one wears a suit that has double vents and
narrow lapels, one will be fashionably dressed.
The suit that Joseph wore to dinner last night
had double vents and narrow lapels, so Joseph
must have been fashionably dressed.

23. Eight large craters run in a long straight line across a
geographical region. Although some of the craters
contain rocks that have undergone high-pressure shocks
characteristic of meteorites slamming into Earth, these
shocks could also have been caused by extreme volcanic
events. Because of the linearity of the craters, it is very
unlikely that some of them were caused by volcanoes
and others were caused by meteorites. Thus, since the
craters are all different ages, they were probably caused
by volcanic events rather than meteorites.
Which one of the following statements, if true, would
most strengthen the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A similar but shorter line of craters that are all
the same age is known to have been caused by
volcanic activity.
No known natural cause would likely account
for eight meteorite craters of different ages
forming a straight line.
There is no independent evidence of either
meteorites or volcanic activity in the region
where the craters are located.
There is no independent evidence of a volcanic
event strong enough to have created the
high-pressure shocks that are characteristic of
meteorites slamming into Earth.
No known single meteor shower has created
exactly eight impact craters that form a straight
line.

24. The genuine creative genius is someone who is
dissatisfied with merely habitual assent to widely held
beliefs; thus these rare innovators tend to anger the
majority. Those who are dissatisfied with merely habitual
assent to widely held beliefs tend to seek out controversy,
and controversy seekers enjoy demonstrating the
falsehood of popular viewpoints.
The conclusion of the argument follows logically if
which one of the following is assumed?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

People become angry when they are dissatisfied
with merely habitual assent to widely held
beliefs.
People who enjoy demonstrating the falsehood
of popular viewpoints anger the majority.
People tend to get angry with individuals who
hold beliefs not held by a majority of people.
People who anger the majority enjoy
demonstrating the falsehood of popular
viewpoints.
People who anger the majority are dissatisfied
with merely habitual assent to widely held
beliefs.

25. Claude: When I’m having lunch with job candidates, I
watch to see if they salt their food without first
tasting it. If they do, I count that against them,
because they’re making decisions based on
inadequate information.
Larissa: That’s silly. It’s perfectly reasonable for me to
wear a sweater whenever I go into a supermarket,
because I already know supermarkets are always
too cool inside to suit me. And I never open a
credit card offer that comes in the mail, because I
already know that no matter how low its interest
rate may be, it will never be worthwhile for me.
The two analogies that Larissa offers can most
reasonably be interpreted as invoking which one of the
following principles to criticize Claude’s policy?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In matters involving personal preference,
performing an action without first ascertaining
whether it is appropriate in the specific
circumstances should not be taken as good
evidence of faulty decision making, because
the action may be based on a reasoned policy
relating to knowledge of a general fact about
the circumstances.
In professional decision-making contexts, those
who have the responsibility of judging other
people’s suitability for a job should not use
observations of job-related behavior as a basis
for inferring general conclusions about those
people’s character.
General conclusions regarding a job candidate’s
suitability for a position should not be based
exclusively on observations of the candidate’s
behavior in situations that are neither directly
job related nor likely to be indicative of a
pattern of behavior that the candidate engages in.
Individuals whose behavior in specific
circumstances does not conform to generally
expected norms should not automatically be
considered unconcerned with meeting social
expectations, because such individuals may be
acting in accordance with reasoned policies
that they believe should be generally adopted
by people in similar circumstances.
Evidence that a particular individual uses bad
decision-making strategies in matters of
personal taste should not be considered
sufficient to warrant a negative assessment of
his or her suitability for a job, because any
good decision maker can have occasional
lapses of rationality with regard to such matters.
