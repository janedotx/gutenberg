SECTION I
Time—35 minutes
26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1. The obsession of economists with consumption as a
measure of economic well-being has prevented us from
understanding the true nature of economic well-being.
We get very little satisfaction out of the fact that our
clothing wears out, our automobiles depreciate, and the
gasoline in our tanks burns up and must be replaced.
The author is arguing that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

economic well-being cannot be deﬁned solely in
terms of consumption
satisfaction is possible without consumption
valid measures of consumption cannot be
devised
modern products are designed for early
obsolescence
satisfaction can provide an adequate quantitative
measure of economic well-being

3. A reason Larson cannot do the assignment is that she
has an unavoidable scheduling conﬂict. On the other
hand, a reason Franks cannot do the assignment is
that he does not quite have the assertiveness the task
requires. So, the task must be assigned to Parker, the
only supervisor in the shipping department other than
Larson and Franks.
The argument depends on assuming which one of the
following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

2.

Commentator: Many people argue that the release of
chloroﬂuorocarbons into the atmosphere is
harming humans by damaging the ozone layer,
thus allowing increased amounts of ultraviolet
radiation to reach Earth. But 300,000 years
ago a supernova greatly damaged the ozone
layer, with no signiﬁcant effect on our earliest
ancestors. Because the supernova’s disruption
was much greater than the estimated effect of
chloroﬂuorocarbons today, there is no reason to
think that these chemicals in the atmosphere harm
humans in this way.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
seriously weaken the commentator’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Extraterrestrial inﬂuences on the ozone layer
tend to occur less often than terrestrial ones.
Natural events, such as the eruption of volcanoes,
continue to damage the ozone layer today.
Our earliest ancestors possessed genetic
characteristics making them more resistant
than we are to the harmful effects of ultraviolet
radiation.
The ozone layer regenerates at a slow rate,
barring counteractive processes.
Scientists have discovered that genetic changes
occurred in our ancestors during the period in
which the supernova affected Earth.

Larson has the assertiveness the task requires.
The task cannot be assigned to anyone other than
a supervisor in the shipping department.
Franks would be assigned the task if Franks had
the assertiveness the task requires.
The task cannot be assigned to anyone who has
any kind of scheduling conﬂict.
No one who is not a supervisor in the shipping
department has the assertiveness this task
requires.

4. Columnist: Analysts argue that as baby boomers reach
the age of 50, they will begin seriously planning
for retirement. This will lead them to switch from
being primarily consumers to being savers. Thus,
these analysts conclude, more money will ﬂow
into the stock market, resulting in continued gains
in stock prices. Analysts would stand to gain if
this were true, but they are being overly
optimistic. As consumption decreases, so will
corporate earnings; therefore high stock prices
will not be justiﬁed, and thus boomers’ money
will more likely ﬂow into investments other than
stocks.
The columnist’s argument does which one of the
following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

attempts to undermine the analysts’ argument by
questioning the truth of its premises
attempts to undermine the analysts’ argument by
suggesting that the analysts present it for selfserving reasons
attempts to undermine the analysts’ argument
by drawing an alternative conclusion from the
analysts’ premises
argues that the analysts’ conclusion is basically
right, but suggests that it is somewhat too
optimistic
argues in favor of the analysts’ conclusion, but
does so on the basis of a different body of
evidence

5. Item removed from scoring.

6.

Maria: Popular music is bad art because it greatly
exaggerates the role love plays in everyday life
and thereby fails to represent reality accurately.
Theo: Popular music is not supposed to reﬂect reality;
it performs other artistic functions, such as
providing consoling fantasies and helping people
create some romance in their often difﬁcult lives.
You should understand popular music before you
condemn it.
The dialogue provides the most support for the claim
that Maria and Theo disagree over whether
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

most good art creates consoling illusions
some bad art exaggerates the role love plays in
everyday life
art should always represent reality as it could be,
not as it is
art need not represent reality accurately to be
good art
popular music should not be considered to be an
art form

7. An artiﬁcial hormone has recently been developed that
increases milk production in cows. Its development has
prompted some lawmakers to propose that milk labels
should be required to provide information to consumers
about what artiﬁcial substances were used in milk
production. This proposal should not be implemented:
just imagine trying to list every synthetic fertilizer used
to grow the grass and grain the cows ate, or every
fungicide used to keep the grain from spoiling!
The argument proceeds by
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

proposing an alternative course of action for
achieving the objectives of the proposal being
argued against
raising considerations in order to show that
the proposal being argued against, if strictly
implemented, would lead to absurd
consequences
using speciﬁc examples in order to show that an
alternative to the proposal being argued against
would better achieve the ends to which the
original proposal was directed
introducing a case analogous to the one
under consideration to show that a general
implementation of the proposal being argued
against would be impossible
questioning the motivation of those who made
the proposal being argued against

8. Trust, which cannot be sustained in the absence of
mutual respect, is essential to any long-lasting
relationship, personal or professional. However,
personal relationships, such as marriage or friendship,
additionally require natural afﬁnity. If a personal
relationship is to endure, it must be supported by the
twin pillars of mutual respect and afﬁnity.
If the statements above are true, then which one of the
following must also be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A friendship supported solely by trust and
mutual respect will not be long-lasting.
In the context of any professional relationship,
mutual respect presupposes trust.
If a personal relationship is supported by mutual
respect and afﬁnity, it will last a long time.
Personal relationships, such as marriage or
friendship, are longer-lasting than professional
relationships.
Basing a marriage on a natural afﬁnity will
ensure that it will endure.

9. The use of phrases like “as so-and-so said” or “as the
saying goes” suggests that the quote that follows has
just been illustrated. Such phrases are inappropriately
used when an apparent counterexample has just been
given.
Which one of the following contains an inappropriate
usage of a phrase, according to the principle stated
above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Fatima was a mathematician who often thought
about unsolved problems of mathematics,
although it was unpleasant to be reminded that
most would probably remain unsolved in her
lifetime. As the saying goes, “Strange how
much you’ve got to know before you know how
little you know.”
Harold’s friends were surprised when he revealed
that he had left his wallet at home and asked
that someone lend him money. But he had done
the same thing many times before. As Halliard
said, “The force of selﬁshness is as inevitable
and as calculable as the force of gravitation.”
The best model of vacuum cleaner was the most
expensive on the market, but it would have
made Roger unhappy to purchase it. For
although he never wanted anything but the best,
he was also quite frugal, and would never have
forgiven himself for spending the money. As the
saying goes, “A penny saved is a penny earned.”
Sharon loved cats, but her husband was allergic
to them. Still, he was occasionally willing to
accompany her to cat shows. As the saying
goes, “Shared lives mean shared loves.”
Raoul spent a year planning and preparing for a
fantastic ski trip. He enjoyed his ski trip greatly
until he broke his leg and had to spend two
weeks in the hospital. As the saying goes, “All’s
well that ends well.”

10. Rachel: Though contemporary artists are pleased
to be free of the constraints that bound their
predecessors, this freedom has caused a decline
in the quality of art. Great art can be produced
only when artists struggle to express themselves
within externally imposed boundaries.
James: People have always been critical of the art of
their own time. They forget all but the greatest
art from past eras. Since inferior contemporary
artworks have not yet been forgotten, people
today mistakenly think that contemporary art is
generally inferior to earlier art.
On the basis of their statements, Rachel and James are
committed to disagreeing with each other about
whether
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

contemporary art is of lower quality than earlier
art
contemporary artists are bound by the same
constraints as their predecessors
great art is produced only when an artist
struggles against limitations
inferior art from past eras is generally forgotten
one can correctly assess the quality of art only if
it was produced in past eras

11. The average cost of groceries will rise again next
month. Consequently, butter and eggs can be expected
to cost more next month.
The ﬂawed reasoning in the argument above most
closely parallels the reasoning in which one of the
following?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The price of gasoline has been rising each month
for the past year. Therefore, we can expect to
pay more for gasoline next month.
Either the government will reduce taxes
or the economy will fall into a recession.
The government is unlikely to reduce taxes
Therefore, the economy will fall into a
recession.
The average amount of time spent by people
younger than 20 in watching television has
recently risen rapidly. Therefore, the amount of
time fourth graders spend watching television
must have risen recently.
Since sugar is a major ingredient in ice cream,
the price of ice cream increases whenever the
price of sugar increases. The price of sugar is
expected to increase next month. Therefore, the
price of ice cream can be expected to increase
next month.
Real estate prices go down when the population
of those from 20 to 30 years old declines, and
the number in that age group will decrease over
the next decade. Therefore, real estate prices
will go down over that period.

12. Biologists have noted reproductive abnormalities in
ﬁsh that are immediately downstream of paper mills.
One possible cause is dioxin, which paper mills release
daily and which can alter the concentration of
hormones in ﬁsh. However, dioxin is unlikely to
be the cause, since the ﬁsh recover normal hormone
concentrations relatively quickly during occasional mill
shutdowns and dioxin decomposes very slowly in the
environment.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
seriously weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Some of the studies that show that ﬁsh recover
quickly during shutdowns were funded by paper
manufacturers.
The rate at which dioxin decomposes varies
depending on the conditions to which it is
exposed.
Normal river currents carry the dioxin present in
the river far downstream in a few hours.
Some of the ﬁsh did not recover rapidly from the
physiological changes that were induced by the
changes in hormone concentrations.
The connection between hormone concentrations
and reproductive abnormalities is not
thoroughly understood.

13. If the play were successful, it would be adapted as a
movie or revived at the Decade Festival. But it is not
successful. We must, regrettably, conclude that it will
neither become a movie nor be revived at the Decade
Festival.
The argument’s reasoning is ﬂawed because the
argument
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

fails to draw the conclusion that the play will not
both be adapted as a movie and be revived at
the Decade Festival, rather than that it will do
neither
fails to explain in exactly what way the play is
unsuccessful
equates the play’s aesthetic worth with its
commercial success
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
there are no further avenues for the play other
than adaptation as a movie or revival at the
Decade Festival
fails to recognize that the play’s not satisfying
one sufﬁcient condition does not preclude its
satisfying a different sufﬁcient condition for
adaptation as a movie or revival at the Decade
Festival

14. Physician: In order to investigate diseases caused by
hormonal imbalances, a certain researcher wants
to study, among others, 200 children whose
pituitary glands fail to produce typical amounts
of Human Growth Hormone (HGH). The study
would involve administering a synthetic version
of HGH to the children over a two-year period.
But medical research should be permitted only if
it is likely to reveal important information about
a medical condition and is known to pose only a
minimal risk to the subjects. The researcher’s
proposed study should be prohibited.
Which one of the following, if true, would most help to
justify the physician’s argumentation?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The resources expended on the HGH study
could be spent instead on research likely to
lead to treatments for medical conditions more
serious than diseases stemming from hormonal
imbalances.
About 10,000 children have already been given
synthetic HGH without obvious side effects.
Obtaining informed consent from children is
impossible, because they are not yet mature
enough to understand complex medical issues.
Although hormonal imbalances can cause
disease, the imbalances themselves do not
constitute a medical condition.
The long-term effects of synthetic HGH have
never been tested and are unknown.

15. At the request of Grove Park residents, speed bumps
were installed on all streets in their neighborhood.
However, although through trafﬁc does cause noise and
congestion in Grove Park, this remedy is blatantly
unfair. The neighborhood is not a private community,
and its streets were built with public funds, and thus all
drivers have the right to use them whenever they please.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that it
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

ignores the possibility that speed bumps may not
reduce the speeds at which drivers drive through
the neighborhood
neglects the possibility that drivers frequently
drive through the neighborhood at high speeds
provides no evidence that drivers have
complained about the new speed bumps in the
neighborhood
contains the tacit assumption that residents of
neighborhoods should have the right to restrict
trafﬁc through their communities
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
speed bumps do prevent drivers from using the
roads on which the bumps are found

16. Literary critic: Often the heirs of a successful writer
decide to publish the manuscripts and the letters
the dead writer left behind, regardless of the
merit of the work. However, many writers have
manuscripts that they judge to be unworthy of
publication and with which they would not like to
be publicly associated even after they die. Hence
a successful writer who decides not to publish a
recently completed manuscript should destroy it
immediately.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
calls into question the soundness of the literary critic’s
advice?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Some writers whose work becomes both popular
and respected after they die received no literary
recognition during their lifetimes.
Writers who achieve a certain degree of
fame can expect that some of their personal
correspondence will become publicly available
after they die.
Most successful writers’ judgments of their
recently completed work is unnecessarily harsh
and is often later revised.
Many posthumously published books would have
been published by the author had the author
lived.
Some heirs of successful writers do not consider
themselves qualiﬁed to judge the merits of a
literary work.

17. In practice the government will have the last word on
what an individual’s rights are, because its police will
do what its ofﬁcials and courts say. But that does not
mean that the government’s view is necessarily the
correct view; anyone who thinks it is must believe
that persons have only such moral rights as the
government chooses to grant, which means that they
have no moral rights at all.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion of the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Individuals have no rights at all unless the
government says that they do.
What government ofﬁcials and courts say an
individual’s rights are may not be correct.
Individuals have rights unless the government
says that they do not.
The police always agree with government
ofﬁcials and the courts about what an
individual’s rights are.
One should always try to uphold one’s individual
rights against the government’s view of what
those rights are.

18. There is evidence to suggest that our cave-dwelling
ancestors polished many of their ﬂints to a degree far
surpassing what was necessary for hunting purposes. It
seems, therefore, that early humans possessed an
aesthetic sense.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
seriously weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Most ﬂints used by our cave-dwelling ancestors
were not highly polished.
The caves in which the highly polished ﬂints
were found are unadorned by cave paintings.
There is evidence that these highly polished ﬂints
were used for display in religious ceremonies.
Flints were often used by early humans for
everyday chores other than hunting.
Any beneﬁts that an aesthetic sense would have
given to cave-dwelling humans are poorly
understood.

20. Reviewer: Many historians claim, in their own
treatment of subject matter, to be as little affected
as any natural scientist by moral or aesthetic
preconceptions. But we clearly cannot accept
these proclamations of objectivity, for it is easy
to ﬁnd instances of false historical explanations
embodying the ideological and other prejudices of
their authors.
The reviewer’s reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism
on the grounds that it
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

19. Columnist: Much of North America and western
Europe is more heavily forested and has less acid
rain and better air quality now than ﬁve decades
ago. Though this may be due largely to policies
advocated by environmentalists, it nonetheless
lends credibility to the claims of people who
reject predictions of imminent ecological doom
and argue that environmental policies that
excessively restrict the use of natural resources
may diminish the wealth necessary to adopt and
sustain the policies that brought about these
improvements.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the columnist’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Nations sustain their wealth largely through
industrial use of the natural resources found
within their boundaries.
The more advanced the technology used in a
nation’s industries, the greater is that nation’s
ability to devote a portion of its resources to
social programs.
A majority of ecological disasters arise from
causes that are beyond human control.
If a compromise between the proponents of
economic growth and the environmentalists had
been enacted rather than the current policies, the
environment would have seen signiﬁcantly less
improvement.
The concern demonstrated by a nation for the
health and integrity of its natural ecosystems
leads to an increase in that nation’s wealth.

(E)

takes for granted that the model of objectivity
offered by the natural sciences should apply in
other ﬁelds
offers evidence that undermines rather than
supports the conclusion it reaches
fails to recognize that many historians employ
methodologies that are intended to uncover and
compensate for prejudices
takes for granted that some historical work that
embodies prejudices is written by historians
who purport to be objective
fails to recognize that not all historical
explanations embodying ideologies are false

21. Although the geological record contains some hints of
major meteor impacts preceding mass extinctions, there
were many extinctions that did not follow any known
major meteor impacts. Likewise, there are many records
of major meteor impacts that do not seem to have been
followed by mass extinctions. Thus the geological
record suggests that there is no consistent causal
link between major meteor impacts and mass
extinctions.
Which one of the following assumptions enables the
argument’s conclusion to be properly inferred?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If there were a consistent causal link between
major meteor impacts and mass extinctions,
then all major meteor impacts would be
followed by mass extinctions.
Major meteor impacts and mass extinctions
cannot be consistently causally linked unless
many mass extinctions have followed major
meteor impacts.
Of the mass extinctions that did not follow
any known major meteor impacts, few if any
followed major meteor impacts of which the
geological record contains no hints.
If there is no consistent causal link between
major meteor impacts and mass extinctions,
then not all mass extinctions could have
followed major meteor impacts.
There could be a consistent causal link between
major meteor impacts and mass extinctions
even if not every major meteor impact has been
followed by a mass extinction.

22. When uncontrollable factors such as lack of rain cause
farmers’ wheat crops to fail, fertilizer and seed dealers,
as well as truckers and mechanics, lose business, and
fuel suppliers are unable to sell enough diesel fuel to
make a proﬁt.
Which one of the following claims follows logically
from the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

If several of the businesses that sell to farmers
do not prosper, it is because farming itself is not
prospering.
If rainfall is below average, those businesses
that proﬁt from farmers’ purchases tend to lose
money.
Farmers are not responsible for the consequences
of a wheat crop’s failing if wheat growth has
been affected by lack of rain.
A country’s dependence on agriculture can lead
to major economic crises.
The consequences of a drought are not restricted
to the drought’s impact on farm productivity.

24. In criminal proceedings, defense attorneys occasionally
attempt to establish that a suspect was not present at the
commission of a crime by comparing the suspect’s
DNA to the DNA of blood or hair samples taken from
the scene of the crime. Although every person’s DNA
is unique, DNA tests often fail to distinguish among
DNA samples taken from distinct individuals. Hence, it
is a mistake to exonerate a suspect simply because that
person’s DNA did not match the DNA samples taken
from the scene of the crime.
Which one of the following is an error in the reasoning
above?
(A)
(B)

(C)
23. For each action we perform, we can know only some
of its consequences. Thus the view that in no situation
can we know what action is morally right would be true
if an action’s being morally right were the same as the
action’s having the best consequences.
The conclusion follows logically if which one of the
following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

On some occasions we can come to learn that it
is morally wrong to perform a certain action.
On some occasions we can know what action is
morally right.
Knowing that an action has the best
consequences requires knowing all the
consequences of that action.
Only the immediate consequences of our actions
are relevant in determining whether they are
morally right.
An action may be morally right for one particular
person without being morally right for all
people.

(D)
(E)

It assumes without warrant that the use of
physical evidence in identifying suspects is
never mistaken.
It confuses a test that incorrectly identiﬁes DNA
samples as coming from the same person with
a test that incorrectly shows as coming from
different persons samples that come from a
single person.
It generalizes about the reliability of all
methods used to identify those involved in the
commission of a crime on the basis of results
that pertain to only a few such methods.
It relies on experimental data derived from DNA
testing that have not been shown to hold under
nonexperimental conditions.
It fails to demonstrate that physical evidence
taken from the scene of a crime is the only sort
of evidence that should be admitted in criminal
court proceedings.

25. Some visitors to the park engage in practices that
seriously harm the animals. Surely, no one who knew
that these practices seriously harm the animals would
engage in them. So it must be concluded that some
of the visitors do not know that these practices seriously
harm the animals.
The pattern of reasoning exhibited by which one of the
following arguments is most similar to that exhibited
by the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Some of the people who worked on the
failed project will be ﬁred. Everyone in this
department played an important part in that
project. Therefore some people in this
department will be ﬁred.
Some of the people who signed the petition were
among the mayor’s supporters. Yet the mayor
denounced everyone who signed the petition.
Hence the mayor denounced some of her own
supporters.
Some of the people polled live outside the
city limits. However, no one who can vote in
city elections lives outside the city. Therefore
some of the people polled cannot vote in the
upcoming city election.
All of the ﬁve original planners are responsible
for this problem. Yet none of the original
planners will admit responsibility for the
problem. Thus some of the people responsible
for the problem will not admit responsibility.
Some members of the Liberal Party are in favor
of the proposed ordinance. But all members of
the city council are opposed to the proposed
ordinance. Hence some members of the city
council are not Liberals.

26. Rapid population growth can be disastrous for a small
city. Ideally there should be at least one municipal
employee for every hundred residents; when too many
people move in at once, city services responsible for
utilities and permits are quickly overloaded. Most city
budgets do not allow for the immediate hiring of new
staff.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

During budget shortages, small cities tend to
place a high priority on basic municipal services
while cutting back on less essential services.
New residents of any city bring with them new
ideas about how a city should be run.
Some large cities can absorb rapid population
growth more readily than many small cities can.
A low unemployment rate is one of the main
reasons that new residents move to a city.
New residents of most small cities do not start
paying city taxes for at least a year.

A number of natural disasters in recent years—
such as earthquakes, major storms, and ﬂoods—that
have affected large populations of people have forced
relief agencies, communities, and entire nations to
reevaluate the ways in which they respond in the
aftermaths of such disasters. They believe that
traditional ways of dealing with disasters have proved
ineffective on several occasions and, in some cases,
have been destructive rather than helpful to the
communities hit by these sudden and unexpected
crises. Traditionally, relief has been based on the
premise that aid in post disaster situations is most
effective if given in the immediate aftermath of an
event. A high priority also has been placed on the
quantity of aid materials, programs, and personnel, in
the belief that the negative impact of a disaster can
be counteracted by a large and rapid infusion of aid.
Critics claim that such an approach often creates
a new set of difﬁculties for already hard-hit
communities. Teams of uninvited experts and
personnel—all of whom need food and shelter—as
well as uncoordinated shipments of goods and the
establishment of programs inappropriate to local
needs can quickly lead to a secondary “disaster” as
already strained local infrastructures break down
under the pressure of this large inﬂux of resources. In
some instances, tons of food have disappeared into
local markets for resale, and, with inadequate
accounting procedures, billions of dollars in aid
money have gone unaccounted for.
To develop a more effective approach, experts
recommend shifting the focus to the long term. A
response that produces lasting beneﬁt, these experts
claim, requires that community members deﬁne the
form and method of aid that are most appropriate to
their needs. Grassroots dialogue designed to facilitate
preparedness should be encouraged in disaster-prone
communities long before the onset of a crisis, so that
in a disaster’s immediate aftermath, relief agencies
can rely on members of affected communities to take
the lead. The practical effect of this approach is that
aid takes the form of a response to the stated desires
of those affected rather than an immediate, though
less informed, action on their behalf.
Though this proposal appears sound, its success
depends on how an important constituency,
namely donors, will respond. Historically,
donors—individuals, corporations, foundations, and
governmental bodies—have been most likely to
respond only in the immediate aftermath of a crisis.

(55)

However, communities affected by disasters typically
have several long-term needs such as the rebuilding
of houses and roads, and thus the months and years
after a disaster are also crucial. Donors that
incorporate dialogue with members of affected
communities into their relief plans could foster
strategies that more efﬁciently utilize immediate aid
as well as provide for the difﬁculties facing
communities in the years after a disaster.

1. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The most useful response to a natural disaster
is one in which relief agencies allow victims to
dictate the type of aid they receive, which will
most likely result in the allocation of long-term
rather than immediate aid.
The quantity of aid given after a natural disaster
reﬂects the desires of donors more than the
needs of recipients, and in some cases great
quantities of aid are destructive rather than
helpful.
Aid that focuses on long-term needs is difﬁcult
to organize because, by its very deﬁnition,
it requires that relief agencies focus on
constructing an adequate dialogue among
recipients, providers, and donors.
Disaster relief efforts have been marked by
inefﬁciencies that attest to the need for donors
and relief agencies to communicate with
affected communities concerning how best to
meet not only their short-term but also their
long-term needs.
Though the years after a disaster are crucial for
communities affected by disasters, the days and
weeks immediately after a disaster are what
capture the attention of donors, thus forcing
relief agencies into the role of mediators
between the two extremes.

2. Which one of the following examples best illustrates
the type of disaster response recommended by the
experts mentioned in the third paragraph?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

After a ﬂood, local ofﬁcials reject three more
expensive proposals before ﬁnally accepting a
contractor’s plan to control a local river with a
dam.
Following a plan developed several years ago by
a relief agency in consultation with donors and
community members, the relief agency provides
temporary shelter immediately after a ﬂood and
later helps rebuild houses destroyed by the ﬂood.
Immediately after a ﬂood, several different relief
agencies, each acting independently, send large
shipments of goods to the affected community
along with teams of highly motivated but
untrained volunteers to coordinate the distribution
of these goods.
At the request of its donors, a private relief agency
delays providing any assistance to victims of a
ﬂood until after the agency conducts a thorough
study of the types of aid most likely to help the
affected community in the long run.
After a ﬂood, government ofﬁcials persuade local
companies to increase their corporate giving
levels and to direct more aid to the surrounding
community.

3. The author of the passage would be most likely to
agree with which one of the following statements?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Disaster relief plans are appropriate only for
disaster-prone communities.
When communities affected by disasters have
articulated their long-term needs, donors
typically have been responsive to those needs.
Donors would likely provide more disaster relief
aid if they had conﬁdence that it would be used
more effectively than aid currently is.
It is not the amount of aid but rather the way
this aid is managed that is the source of current
problems in disaster relief.
Few communities affected by disasters
experience a crucial need for short-term aid.

4. The author discusses donors in the ﬁnal paragraph
primarily in order to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

point to an inﬂuential group of people who have
resisted changes to traditional disaster response
efforts
demonstrate that the needs of donors and aid
recipients contrast profoundly on the issue of
disaster response
show that implementing an effective disaster
relief program requires a new approach on the
part of donors as well as relief agencies
illustrate that relief agencies and donors share
similar views on the goals of disaster response
but disagree on the proper response methods
concede that the reformation of disaster relief
programs, while necessary, is unlikely to take
place because of the disagreements among
donors

5. It can be inferred from the passage that the author
would be most likely to view a shift toward a more
long-term perspective in disaster relief efforts as which
one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

a development that would beneﬁt affected
communities as well as aid providers who have
a shared interest in relief efforts that are
effective and well managed
a change that would help communities meet
their future needs more effectively but would
inevitably result in a detrimental reduction of
short-term aid like food and medicine
an approach that would enable aid recipients to
meet their long-term needs but which would not
address the mismanagement that hampers shortterm relief efforts
a movement that, while well intentioned, will
likely be undermined by the unwillingness of
donors to accept new methods of delivering aid
the beginning of a trend in which aid recipients
play a major role after a disaster and donors
play a minor role, reversing the structure of
traditional aid programs

6. Which one of the following inferences about natural
disasters and relief efforts is most strongly supported by
the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Although inefﬁciencies have long been present in
international disaster relief programs, they have
been aggravated in recent years by increased
demands on relief agencies’ limited resources.
Local communities had expressed little
interest in taking responsibility for their own
preparedness prior to the most recent years, thus
leaving donors and relief agencies unaware of
potential problems.
Numerous relief efforts in the years prior to the
most recent provided such vast quantities of
aid that most needs were met despite evidence
of inefﬁciency and mismanagement, and few
recipient communities questioned traditional
disaster response methods.
Members of communities affected by disasters
have long argued that they should set the agenda
for relief efforts, but relief agencies have only
recently come to recognize the validity of their
arguments.
A number of wasteful relief efforts in the most
recent years provided dramatic illustrations
of aid programs that were implemented by
donors and agencies with little accountability to
populations affected by disasters.

The moral precepts embodied in the Hippocratic
oath, which physicians standardly afﬁrm upon
beginning medical practice, have long been
considered the immutable bedrock of medical ethics,
binding physicians in a moral community that reaches
across temporal, cultural, and national barriers. Until
very recently the promises expressed in that oath—for
example to act primarily for the beneﬁt and not the
harm of patients and to conform to various standards
of professional conduct including the preservation of
patients’ conﬁdences—even seemed impervious to the
powerful scientiﬁc and societal forces challenging it.
Critics argue that the oath is outdated; its ﬁxed moral
rules, they say, are incompatible with more ﬂexible
modern ideas about ethics. It also encourages doctors
to adopt an authoritarian stance that depreciates the
privacy and autonomy of the patient. Furthermore, its
emphasis on the individual patient without regard for
the wider social context frustrates the physician’s
emerging role as gatekeeper in managed care plans
and impedes competitive market forces, which, some
critics believe, should determine the quality, price,
and distribution of health care as they do those of
other commodities. The oath is also faulted for its
omissions: its failure to mention such vital
contemporary issues as human experimentation and
the relationships of physicians to other health
professionals. Some respected opponents even cite
historical doubts about the oath’s origin and
authorship, presenting evidence that it was formulated
by a small group of reformist physicians in ancient
Greece and that for centuries it was not uniformly
accepted by medical practitioners.
This historical issue may be dismissed at the
outset as irrelevant to the oath’s current
appropriateness. Regardless of the speciﬁc origin of
its text—which, admittedly, is at best
uncertain—those in each generation who critically
appraise its content and judge it to express valid
principles of medical ethics become, in a more
meaningful sense, its authors. More importantly, even
the more substantive, morally based arguments
concerning contemporary values and newly relevant
issues cannot negate the patients’ need for assurance
that physicians will pursue appropriate goals in
treatment in accordance with generally acceptable
standards of professionalism. To fulﬁll that need, the
core value of beneﬁcence—which does not actually
conﬂict with most reformers’ purposes—should be
retained, with adaptations at the oath’s periphery by
some combination of revision, supplementation, and
modern interpretation. In fact, there is already a
tradition of peripheral reinterpretation of traditional
wording; for example, the oath’s vaguely and
archaically worded proscription against “cutting for
the stone” may once have served to forbid surgery,
but with today’s safer and more effective surgical
techniques it is understood to function as a promise
to practice within the conﬁnes of one’s expertise,
which remains a necessary safeguard for patients’
safety and well-being.

7. Which one of the following most accurately states the
main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The Hippocratic oath ought to be reevaluated
carefully, with special regard to the role of the
physician, to make certain that its fundamental
moral rules still apply today.
Despite recent criticisms of the Hippocratic oath,
some version of it that will continue to assure
patients of physicians’ professionalism and
beneﬁcent treatment ought to be retained.
Codes of ethics developed for one society at a
particular point in history may lose some
speciﬁc application in later societies but can
retain a useful fundamental moral purpose.
Even the criticisms of the Hippocratic oath based
on contemporary values and newly relevant
medical issues cannot negate patients’ need for
assurance.
Modern ideas about ethics, especially medical
ethics, obviate the need for and appropriateness
of a single code of medical ethics like the
Hippocratic oath.

8. Which one of the following most accurately describes
the organization of the material presented in the
passage?
(A)

criticisms.
A set of criticisms is put forward, and possible
replies to those criticisms are considered and

value at the heart of the Hippocratic oath that should
present no difﬁculty to most reformers?
(A)

creation of a community of physicians from all
eras, nations, and cultures
constant improvement and advancement of
medical science

11. Based on information in the passage, it can be inferred
that which one of the following sentences could
most logically be added to the passage as a
concluding sentence?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The fact that such reinterpretations are so easy,
however, suggests that our rejection of the
historical issue was perhaps premature.
Yet, where such piecemeal reinterpretation is not
possible, revisions to even the core value of the
oath may be necessary.
It is thus simply a failure of the imagination, and
not any changes in the medical profession or
society in general, that has motivated critics of
the Hippocratic oath.
Because of this tradition of reinterpretation of the
Hippocratic oath, therefore, modern ideas about
medical ethics must be much more ﬂexible than
they have been in the past.
Despite many new challenges facing the medical
profession, therefore, there is no real need for
wholesale revision of the Hippocratic oath.

2

2 2
The oath encourages authoritarianism on the part
of physicians.
The version of the oath in use today is not
identical to the oath formulated in ancient
Greece.
The oath fails to address modern medical
dilemmas that could not have been foreseen in
ancient Greece.
The oath’s absolutism is incompatible with
contemporary views of morality.
The oath’s emphasis on the individual patient
is often not compatible with a market-driven
medical industry.

A lichen consists of a fungus living in symbiosis
(i.e., a mutually beneﬁcial relationship) with an alga.
Although most branches of the complex evolutionary
family tree of fungi have been well established, the
evolutionary origins of lichen-forming fungi have
been a mystery. But a new DNA study has revealed
the relationship of lichen-forming fungi to several
previously known branches of the fungus family tree.
The study reveals that, far from being oddities,
lichen-forming fungi are close relatives of such
common fungi as brewer’s yeast, morel mushrooms,
and the fungus that causes Dutch elm disease. This
accounts for the visible similarity of certain lichens to
more recognizable fungi such as mushrooms.
In general, fungi present complications for the
researcher. Fungi are usually parasitic or symbiotic,
and researchers are often unsure whether they are
examining fungal DNA or that of the associated
organism. But lichen-forming fungi are especially
difﬁcult to study. They have few distinguishing
characteristics of shape or structure, and they are
unusually difﬁcult to isolate from their partner
algae, with which they have a particularly delicate
symbiosis. In some cases the alga is wedged between
layers of fungal tissue; in others, the fungus grows
through the alga’s cell walls in order to take
nourishment, and the tissues of the two organisms
are entirely enmeshed and inseparable. As a result,
lichen-forming fungi have long been difﬁcult to
classify deﬁnitively within the fungus family. By
default they were thus considered a separate grouping
of fungi with an unknown evolutionary origin. But,
using new analytical tools that allow them to isolate
the DNA of fungi in parasitic or symbiotic
relationships, researchers were able to establish the
DNA sequence in a certain gene found in 75 species
of fungi, including 10 species of lichen-forming
fungi. Based on these analyses, the researchers found
5 branches on the fungus family tree to which
varieties of lichen-forming fungi belong.
Furthermore, the researchers stress that it is likely
that as more types of lichen-forming fungi are
analyzed, they will be found to belong to still more
branches of the fungus family tree.
One implication of the new research is that it
provides evidence to help overturn the long-standing
evolutionary assumption that parasitic interactions
inevitably evolve over time to a greater benignity and
eventually to symbiosis so that the parasites will not
destroy their hosts. The addition of lichen-forming
fungi to positions along branches of the fungus
family tree indicates that this assumption does not
hold for fungi. Fungi both harmful and benign can
now be found both early and late in fungus
evolutionary history. Given the new layout of the
fungus family tree resulting from the lichen study, it
appears that fungi can evolve toward mutualism and
then just as easily turn back again toward parasitism.

Lichen-forming fungi are difﬁcult to distinguish
from several common fungi with which they are
closely related.
Lichen-forming fungi were grouped separately
from other fungi on the fungus family tree.
Lichen-forming fungi are far less common than
more recognizable fungi such as mushrooms.
The DNA of lichen-forming fungi is signiﬁcantly
more complex than that of other fungi.

(E)

Evolutionary theorists now postulate that
symbiotic interactions generally evolve toward
greater parasitism, rather than vice versa.
The evolutionary tree of fungi is somewhat
more complex than that of similarly parasitic or
symbiotic organisms.
The DNA of fungi involved in symbiotic
interactions is far more difﬁcult to isolate than
that of fungi involved in parasitic interactions.
The placement of lichen-forming fungi as a
separate group on the fungus family tree
masked the fact that parasitic fungi sometimes
evolved much later than symbiotic ones.
Branches of the fungus family tree that have
evolved from symbiosis to parasitism usually
die out shortly thereafter.

The struggle to obtain legal recognition of
aboriginal rights is a difﬁcult one, and even if a right
is written into the law there is no guarantee that the
future will not bring changes to the law that
undermine the right. For this reason, the federal
government of Canada in 1982 extended
constitutional protection to those aboriginal rights
already recognized under the law. This protection was
extended to the Indian, Inuit, and Métis peoples, the
three groups generally thought to comprise the
aboriginal population in Canada. But this decision has
placed on provincial courts the enormous burden of
interpreting and translating the necessarily general
constitutional language into speciﬁc rulings. The
result has been inconsistent recognition and
establishment of aboriginal rights, despite the
continued efforts of aboriginal peoples to raise issues
concerning their rights.
Aboriginal rights in Canada are deﬁned by the
constitution as aboriginal peoples’ rights to ownership
of land and its resources, the inherent right of
aboriginal societies to self-government, and the right
to legal recognition of indigenous customs. But
difﬁculties arise in applying these broadly conceived
rights. For example, while it might appear
straightforward to afﬁrm legal recognition of
indigenous customs, the exact legal meaning of
“indigenous” is extremely difﬁcult to interpret. The
intent of the constitutional protection is to recognize
only long-standing traditional customs, not those of
recent origin; provincial courts therefore require
aboriginal peoples to provide legal documentation
that any customs they seek to protect were practiced
sufﬁciently long ago—a criterion deﬁned in practice
to mean prior to the establishment of British
sovereignty over the speciﬁc territory. However, this
requirement makes it difﬁcult for aboriginal societies,
which often relied on oral tradition rather than written
records, to support their claims.
Furthermore, even if aboriginal peoples are
successful in convincing the courts that speciﬁc rights
should be recognized, it is frequently difﬁcult to
determine exactly what these rights amount to.
Consider aboriginal land claims. Even when
aboriginal ownership of speciﬁc lands is fully
established, there remains the problem of interpreting
the meaning of that “ownership.” In a 1984 case in
Ontario, an aboriginal group claimed that its property
rights should be interpreted as full ownership in the
contemporary sense of private property, which allows
for the sale of the land or its resources. But the
provincial court instead ruled that the law had
previously recognized only the aboriginal right to use
the land and therefore granted property rights so
minimal as to allow only the bare survival of the

2

2 2
(60)

community. Here, the provincial court’s ruling was
excessively conservative in its assessment of the
current law. Regrettably, it appears that this group
will not be successful unless it is able to move its
case from the provincial courts into the Supreme
Court of Canada, which will be, one hopes, more
insistent upon a satisfactory application of the
constitutional reforms.

20. Which one of the following most accurately states the
main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The overly conservative rulings of Canada’s
provincial courts have been a barrier to
constitutional reforms intended to protect
aboriginal rights.
The overwhelming burden placed on provincial
courts of interpreting constitutional language in
Canada has halted efforts by aboriginal peoples
to gain full ownership of land.
Constitutional language aimed at protecting
aboriginal rights in Canada has so far left the
protection of these rights uncertain due to the
difﬁcult task of interpreting this language.
Constitutional reforms meant to protect
aboriginal rights in Canada have in fact been
used by some provincial courts to limit these
rights.
Efforts by aboriginal rights advocates to
uphold constitutional reforms in Canada may be
more successful if heard by the Supreme Court
rather than by the provincial courts.

21. Which one of the following most accurately describes
the author’s main purpose in lines 11-14 of the passage?
(A)

would be most likely to agree with which one of the
following statements about the 1984 case in Ontario?
(A)

(B)

(C)
24. The passage provides evidence to suggest that the
author would be most likely to assent to which one of
the following proposals?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Aboriginal peoples in Canada should not be
answerable to the federal laws of Canada.
Oral tradition should sometimes be considered
legal documentation of certain indigenous
customs.
Aboriginal communities should be granted full
protection of all of their customs.
Provincial courts should be given no authority to
decide cases involving questions of aboriginal
rights.
The language of the Canadian constitution
should more carefully delineate the instances to
which reforms apply.

Other Ontario courts had previously interpreted
“use” to include sale of the land or its resources.
The ruling created thousands of jobs by opening
the land in question to logging by a timber
corporation.
Previous court decisions in Ontario have
distinguished the right to use land from the right
to sell it.
The ruling prompted aboriginal groups in other
provinces to pursue land claims in those courts.
Prior to the decision in question, the provincial
court had not heard a case concerning the
constitutional reforms.

(D)
(E)

The court’s ruling directly contravened the
language of the constitutional reforms
protecting aboriginal land ownership rights in
the full modern sense.
The Supreme Court remains the best hope for
the recognition of full aboriginal property rights
because provincial courts are not authorized to
rule on the deﬁnition of property rights.
If there had been clear documentary evidence
that the group had occupied the land before the
establishment of British sovereignty, the court
would probably have upheld the aboriginal
claims.
The unsatisfactory ruling in the case was the
result of pressure from conservative politicians
and other conservative interests.
The court correctly understood the intent of the
constitutional reforms, but it failed to apply
them correctly because it misconstrued their
relation to existing law.

25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1. Mayor McKinney’s policies have often been criticized
on the grounds that they beneﬁt only wealthy city
residents, but that is not a fair evaluation. Some of
McKinney’s policies have clearly beneﬁted the city’s
less afﬂuent residents. McKinney actively supported
last year’s proposal to lower the city’s high property
taxes. Because of this tax decrease, more development
is taking place in the city, helping to end the housing
shortage and stabilize the rents in the city.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is impossible to tell whether McKinney is
more committed to the interests of the wealthy
than to those of the poor.
McKinney’s policies have often been criticized
for beneﬁting only wealthy city residents.
The decrease in property taxes that McKinney
supported caused more development to take
place in the city.
The criticism that McKinney’s policies beneﬁt
only the wealthy is unjustiﬁed.
McKinney’s efforts helped end the housing
shortage and stabilize the rents in the city.

2. A factory spokesperson argued that the factory should
not be required to clean up the water in the nearby
wetlands, maintaining that although wastewater from
the factory polluted the wetlands over the past several
years, the factory is not to blame for this, since the
disposal of the factory’s wastewater is handled entirely
by an independent contractor.
Which one of the following arguments most closely
conforms to the principle underlying the reasoning in
the spokesperson’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A recent survey revealed that over two-thirds of
the teachers in the district are permitted to teach
classes on subjects in which they have received
no formal training. Thus parents of students in
the district should check the qualiﬁcations of
their children’s teachers.
I object to the policy of making parents
responsible for the offenses of their older
adolescent children. After all, these adolescents
have minds of their own and freely choose to
act as they do, often in ways that do not reﬂect
the wishes of their parents.
The students are justiﬁed in their objection to
the reading assignment. Many of the topics
concern material that is not covered in class,
and students should not be required to do such
reading in order to do well in the course.
The most recent appointee to the prize committee
should not be permitted to participate in the
selection of this year’s winner. Unlike each of
the other committee members, the appointee has
a relative in the contest.
Despite all the publicity, I am skeptical of the
politician’s claims of having just returned from
the remote village. Just two days ago a reporter
spoke with the villagers and said that not a
single one reported seeing the politician in the
past several months.

Nylon industry spokesperson: Even though cotton and
nylon are used for similar purposes, some people
have the mistaken notion that cotton is natural
but nylon is not. However, nylon’s main
components come from petroleum and from the
nitrogen in the atmosphere. Clearly the
atmosphere is natural. And petroleum comes from
oil, which in turn comes from ancient plants—a
natural source.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the nylon industry spokesperson’s
reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A substance is unnatural only if the function it
serves is unnatural.
A substance is no less natural than the processes
used in its production.
A substance is no more natural than its least
natural component.
One substance can be more natural than another
if only one is wholly derived from natural
substances.
A substance is natural if the origins of its main
cornponents are natural.

4. Computer manufacturers and retailers tell us that the
complexity involved in connecting the various
components of personal computers is not a widespread
obstacle to their use, but this is wrong. Customers who
install accessories to their personal computers have to
take full responsibility for the setting of jumpers and
switches to satisfy mysterious speciﬁcations. Many
accessories require extra software that can cause other
accessories to stop working; adding a modem, for
instance, may disable a printer.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Personal computer instruction manuals usually
explain the purposes of the jumpers and
switches.
Software for accessories can often be obtained
for free.
Installing an accessory will become extremely
easy in the foreseeable future.
A personal computer is usually sold as part of
a package that includes accessories and free
installation.
Computer manufacturers rarely take into account
ease of installation when they are designing
programs or accessones.

5. Rats fed high doses of the artiﬁcial sweetener saccharin
develop silicate crystals that are toxic to cells lining
the bladder. When the cells regenerate, some are
cancerous and form tumors. Unlike rats, mice fed high
doses of saccharin do not get bladder cancer.
Which one of the following, if true, does the most
to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information
above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Urine proteins that react with saccharin to form
silicate crystals are found in rats but not in mice.
Cells in the bladder regenerate more quickly in
mice than they do in rats.
High doses of saccharin are much more likely to
produce silicate crystals than lower doses are.
The silicate crystals are toxic only to the cells
lining the bladder and not to other bladder cells.
High doses of other artiﬁcial sweeteners have
been shown to produce silicate crystals in mice
but not in rats.

6. Although we could replace the beautiful—but
dilapidated—old bridge across Black River with a
concrete skyway, we should instead replace it with a
cable bridge even though this would be more expensive
than building a concrete skyway. The extra cost is
clearly justiﬁed by the importance of maintaining the
beauty of our river crossing.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is no more costly to maintain a cable bridge
than a concrete skyway.
A concrete skyway would not have any practical
advantages over a cable bridge.
The beauty of the river crossing must be
preserved.
If the new cable bridge is built, most people who
see it will think the extra money well spent.
Building a cable bridge across Black River
would produce a more aesthetically pleasing
result than building a concrete skyway.

7. A typical gasoline-powered lawn mower emits about as
much air-polluting material per hour of use as does an
automobile. Collectively, such mowers contribute
signiﬁcantly to summer air pollution. Since electric
mowers emit no air pollutants, people can help reduce
air pollution by choosing electric mowers over gasoline
ones whenever feasible.
Which one of the following, if true, provides the most
support for the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Lawns help to clean the air, replacing pollutants
with oxygen.
Electric lawn mowers are more expensive
to purchase and maintain than are gasoline
mowers.
Producing the power to run an electric mower
for an hour causes less air pollution than does
running an automobile for an hour.
Most manufacturers of gasoline lawn mowers are
trying to redesign their mowers to reduce the
emission of air pollutants.
Lawn mowers are used for fewer hours per year
than are automobiles.

Public health expert: Until recently people believed
that applications of biochemical research would
eventually achieve complete victory over the
microorganisms that cause human disease.
However, current medical research shows that
those microorganisms reproduce so rapidly that
medicines developed for killing one variety will
only spur the evolution of other varieties that are
immune to those medicines. The most rational
public health strategy, therefore, would place
much more emphasis than at present on fully
informing people about the transmission of
diseases caused by microorganisms, with a view
to minimizing the incidence of such diseases.
Of the following, which one most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn by the public health expert?
(A)
(B)
(C)

8.

Ariel: Government art subsidies never beneﬁt art,
for art’s role is to challenge society’s values. A
society’s values, however, are expressed by its
government, and artists cannot challenge the very
institution upon which they depend.
Sasha: I agree that art should challenge society’s
values. However, by its very nature, a democratic
government respects dissent and encourages
challenges to its own values. Therefore, in a
democratic society, government art subsidies
ensure that artists can be fully committed to their
work while expressing themselves freely.
The dialogue most supports the claim that Ariel and
Sasha disagree with each other about whether
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

art’s role is to challenge society’s values
a society’s values are expressed by its
government
artists can express themselves freely in a
nondemocratic society
art subsidies provided by a democratic
government beneﬁt art
only governments that respect dissent ensure that
art subsidies are fairly distributed

(D)
(E)

A medicine that kills one variety of diseasecausing microorganism can cause the evolution
of a drug-resistant variety.
A patient who contracts a disease caused by
microorganisms cannot be effectively cured by
present methods.
There is good reason to make a particular change
to public health policy.
No one who is fully informed about the diseases
caused by microorganisms will ever fall victim
to those diseases.
Some previous approaches to public health
policy ignored the fact that disease-causing
microorganisms reproduce at a rapid rate.

10. The enthusiastic acceptance of ascetic lifestyles
evidenced in the surviving writings of monastic authors
indicates that medieval societies were much less
concerned with monetary gain than are contemporary
Western cultures.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

employs the imprecise term “ascetic”
generalizes from a sample that is likely to be
unrepresentative
applies contemporary standards inappropriately
to medieval societies
inserts personal opinions into what purports to be
a factual debate
advances premises that are inconsistent

11. Between 1976 and 1985, chemical wastes were dumped
into Cod Bay. Today, 3 percent of the bay’s blueﬁn
cod population have deformed ﬁns, and wary
consumers have stopped buying the ﬁsh. In seeking
ﬁnancial reparations from companies that dumped the
chemicals, representatives of Cod Bay’s ﬁshing industry
have claimed that since the chemicals are known to
cause genetic mutations, the deformity in the blueﬁn
cod must have been caused by the presence of those
chemicals in Cod Bay.
The answer to each of the following questions would be
helpful in evaluating the representatives’ claim
EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

What is the incidence of deformed ﬁns in blueﬁn
cod that are not exposed to chemicals such as
those dumped into Cod Bay?
What was the incidence of deformed ﬁns in
blueﬁn cod in Cod Bay before the chemical
dumping began?
Has the consumption of the blueﬁn cod from
Cod Bay that have deformed ﬁns caused any
health problems in the people who ate them?
Are blueﬁn cod prone to any naturally occurring
diseases that can cause ﬁn deformities of the
same kind as those displayed by the blueﬁn cod
of Cod Bay?
Are there gene-altering pollutants present in Cod
Bay other than the chemical wastes that were
dumped by the companies?

12. Columnist: If you received an unsigned letter, you
would likely have some doubts about the truth
of its contents. But news stories often include
statements from anonymous sources, and these are
usually quoted with the utmost respect. It makes
sense to be skeptical of these sources, for, as in
the case of the writer of an unsigned letter, their
anonymity makes it possible for them to plant
inaccurate or slanted statements without ever
having to answer for them.
The columnist’s argument proceeds by
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

pointing out that a certain attitude would
presumably be adopted in one situation, in order
to support the claim that a similar attitude
would be justiﬁed in an analogous situation
drawing an analogy between an attitude
commonly adopted in one situation and a
different attitude commonly adopted in another
situation, and establishing that the latter attitude
is better justiﬁed than the former
inferring that an attitude would be justiﬁed in all
situations of a given type on the grounds that
this attitude is justiﬁed in a hypothetical
situation of that type
calling into question a certain type of evidence
by drawing an analogy between that evidence
and other evidence that the argument shows is
usually false
calling into question the motives of those
presenting certain information, and concluding
for this reason that the information is likely to
be false

13. Art theft from museums is on the rise. Most stolen art is
sold to wealthy private collectors. Consequently, since
thieves steal what their customers are most interested
in buying, museums ought to focus more of their
security on their most valuable pieces.
The argument depends on assuming which one of the
following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Art thieves steal both valuable and not-sovaluable art.
Art pieces that are not very valuable are not very
much in demand by wealthy private collectors.
Art thieves steal primarily from museums that
are poorly secured.
Most museums provide the same amount of
security for valuable and not-so-valuable art.
Wealthy private collectors sometimes sell their
stolen art to other wealthy private collectors.

14. Insufﬁcient rain can cause crops to falter and
agricultural prices to rise. Records indicate that during
a certain nation’s recent crisis, faltering crops and rising
agricultural prices prompted the government to take
over food distribution in an effort to prevent starvation.
Thus, the weather must have played an important role
in bringing about the crisis.
The argument’s reasoning is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

concludes, merely from the fact that the period
of insufﬁcient rain occurred before the nation’s
crisis, that insufﬁcient rain caused the nation’s
crisis
fails to take into account the possibility that the
scarcity was not severe enough to justify the
government’s taking over food distribution
uses the term “crisis” equivocally in the
reasoning, referring to both a political crisis and
an economic crisis
infers, merely from the fact that one event could
have caused a second event, that the ﬁrst event
in fact caused the second
takes for granted that any condition that is
necessary for an increase in agricultural prices
is also sufﬁcient for such an increase

15. The cost of a semester’s tuition at a certain university
is based on the number of courses in which a student
enrolls that semester. Although the cost per course at
that university has not risen in four years, many of its
students who could afford the tuition when they ﬁrst
enrolled now claim they can no longer afford it.
Each of the following, if true, helps to resolve the
apparent discrepancy above EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Faculty salaries at the university have risen
slightly over the past four years.
The number of courses per semester for which
full-time students are required to enroll is higher
this year than any time in the past.
The cost of living in the vicinity of the university
has risen over the last two years.
The university awards new students a large
number of scholarships that are renewed each
year for the students who maintain high grade
averages.
The university has turned many of its part-time
ofﬁce jobs, for which students had generally
been hired, into full-time, nonstudent positions.

16. People are not happy unless they feel that they are
needed by others. Most people in modern society,
however, can achieve a feeling of indispensability only
within the sphere of family and friendship, because
almost everyone knows that his or her job could be
done by anyone of thousands of others.
The statements above most strongly support which one
of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

People who realize that others could ﬁll their
occupational roles as ably as they do themselves
cannot achieve any happiness in their lives.
The nature of modern society actually
undermines the importance of family life to an
individual’s happiness.
Most people in modern society are happy in their
private lives even if they are not happy in their
jobs.
A majority of people in modern society do not
appreciate having the jobs that they do have.
Fewer than a majority of people in modern
society can ﬁnd happiness outside the sphere of
private interpersonal relationships.

17. Art critic: Criticism focuses on two issues: ﬁrst,
whether the value of an artwork is intrinsic to the
work; and second, whether judgments about an
artwork’s quality are objective rather than merely
matters of taste. These issues are related, for if an
artwork’s value is not intrinsic, then it must be
extrinsic, and thus judgments about the quality of
the work can only be a matter of taste.
The art critic’s reasoning is most vulnerable to the
criticism that it takes for granted that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

judgments about the quality of an artwork are
always a matter of taste
people sometimes agree about judgments that are
only matters of taste
judgments about extrinsic value cannot be
objective
judgments about intrinsic value are always
objective
an artwork’s value is sometimes intrinsic to it

18. Decentralization enables divisions of a large institution
to function autonomously. This always permits more
realistic planning and strongly encourages innovation,
since the people responsible for decision making are
directly involved in implementing the policies they
design. Decentralization also permits the central
administration to focus on institution-wide issues
without being overwhelmed by the details of daily
operations.
The statements above most strongly support which one
of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

In large institutions whose divisions do not
function autonomously, planning is not
maximally realistic.
Innovation is not always encouraged in large
centralized institutions.
For large institutions the advantages of
decentralization outweigh its disadvantages.
The central administrations of large institutions
are usually partially responsible for most of the
details of daily operations.
The people directly involved in implementing,
policies are always able to make innovative and
realistic policy decisions.

20. Polling data reveal that an overwhelming majority of
nine-year-olds can correctly identify the logos of major
cigarette brands. However, of those nine-year-olds who
recognize such logos, less than 1 percent smoke.
Therefore, there is little or no connection between
recognition of cigarette brand logos and smoking.
Which one of the following uses ﬂawed reasoning most
similar to the ﬂawed reasoning above?

(C)

(D)
19. According to some astronomers, Earth is struck by a
meteorite large enough to cause an ice age on an
average of once every 100 million years. The last such
incident occurred nearly 100 million years ago, so we
can expect that Earth will be struck by such a meteorite
in the near future. This clearly warrants funding to
determine whether there is a means to protect our planet
from such meteorite strikes.
The reasoning in the argument is most subject to
criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

makes a bold prescription on the basis of
evidence that establishes only a high probability
for a disastrous event
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
the probability of a chance event’s occurring is
not affected by whether the event has occurred
during a period in which it would be expected to
occur
moves from evidence about the average
frequency of an event to a speciﬁc prediction
about when the next such event will occur
fails to specify the likelihood that, if such a
meteorite should strike Earth, the meteorite
would indeed cause an ice age
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
some feasible means can be found to deter large
meteorite strikes

the ocean is unfounded. During a three-month
observation period, 1,000 dolphins were
exposed to small quantities of mercury in
seawater, with no effect on the animals.
Many ten-year-olds dream of becoming actors.
Yet it is not likely they will seriously consider
becoming actors, because most parents
discourage their children from pursuing such a
highly competitive career.
Most dentists recommend using ﬂuoride to
reduce the incidence of cavities, but few
recommend giving up candy entirely; so, using
ﬂuoride is probably more effective in preventing
cavities than is avoiding sweets.
A large percentage of men exercise moderately
throughout their lives, but the average life span
of those who do so is not signiﬁcantly greater
than of those who get little or no exercise.
So there is little or no correlation between
moderate exercise and good health.
Most people cannot name their legislative
representatives. Nonetheless, this is
insigniﬁcant, for when queried, most of them
displayed an adequate command of current
political issues.

21. Etiquette ﬁrmly opposes both obscene and malicious
talk, but this does not imply that speech needs to be
restricted by law. Etiquette does not necessarily even
oppose the expression of offensive ideas. Rather, it
dictates that there are situations in which the expression
of potentially offensive, disturbing, or controversial
ideas is inappropriate and that, where appropriate, the
expression and discussion of such ideas is to be done
in a civil manner.
Which one of the following judgments most closely
corresponds to the principles of etiquette stated above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Neighbors should not be gruff or unfriendly to
one another when they meet on the street.
When prosecutors elicit testimony from a
cooperative witness they should do so without
intensive questioning.
There should be restrictions on speech only if a
large majority of the population ﬁnds the speech
offensive and hateful.
The journalists at a news conference should
not ask a politician potentially embarrassing
questions about a controversial policy issue.
The moderator of a panel discussion of a divisive
moral issue should not allow participants to
engage in name-calling.

22. The only preexisting recordings that are transferred
onto compact disc are those that record companies
believe will sell well enough on compact disc to be
proﬁtable. So, most classic jazz recordings will not be
transferred onto compact disc, because few classic jazz
recordings are played on the radio.
The conclusion above follows logically if which one of
the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Few of the preexisting recordings that record
companies believe can be proﬁtably transferred
to compact disc are classic jazz recordings.
Few compact discs featuring classic jazz
recordings are played on the radio.
The only recordings that are played on the radio
are ones that record companies believe can be
proﬁtably sold as compact discs.
Most record companies are less interested in
preserving classic jazz recordings than in
making a proﬁt.
No recording that is not played on the radio is
one that record companies believe would be
proﬁtable if transferred to compact disc.

23. Agricultural economist: Over the past several years,
increases in worldwide grain production have
virtually ceased. Further increases will be
extremely difﬁcult; most usable farmland is
already being farmed with near-maximal
efﬁciency. But worldwide demand for grain
has been increasing steadily, due largely to
continuing population growth. Hence, a severe
worldwide grain shortage is likely.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the agricultural economist’s argument
by the claim that further increases in worldwide grain
production will be extremely difﬁcult?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is one of the two conclusions drawn by the
agricultural economist, neither of which is used
to provide support for the other.
It is a description of a phenomenon, a causal
explanation of which is the main conclusion of
the argument.
It is the only premise offered in support of the
argument’s main conclusion.
It is a prediction for which the agricultural
economist’s ﬁrst claim is offered as the primary
justiﬁcation.
It is an intermediate conclusion that is presented
as evidence for the argument’s main conclusion.

24. Bardis: Extensive research shows that television
advertisements affect the buying habits of
consumers. Some people conclude from this
that violent television imagery sometimes
causes violent behavior. But the effectiveness
of television advertisements could be a result
of those televised images being speciﬁcally
designed to alter buying habits, whereas
television violence is not designed to cause
violent behavior. Hence we can safely conclude
that violent television imagery does not cause
violence.
The reasoning in Bardis’s argument is ﬂawed because
that argument
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

relies on an illegitimate inference from the fact
that advertisements can change behavior to the
claim that advertisements can cause violent
behavior
fails to distinguish a type of behavior from a type
of stimulus that may or may not affect behavior
undermines its own position by questioning the
persuasive power of television advertising
concludes that a claim is false on the basis of one
purported fault in an argument in favor of that
claim
fails to consider the possibility that the argument
it disputes is intended to address a separate
issue

25. Sarah: Our regulations for staff review are vague
and thus difﬁcult to interpret. For instance,
the regulations state that a staff member who
is performing unsatisfactorily will face
dismissal, but they fail to deﬁne unsatisfactory
performance. Thus, some staff may be dismissed
merely because their personal views conﬂict with
those of their supervisors.
Which one of the following generalizations, if
applicable to Sarah’s company, most helps to justify
her reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Performance that falls only somewhat below
expectations results in disciplinary measures
short of dismissal.
Interpreting regulations is a prerogative that
belongs solely to supervisors.
A vague regulation can be used to make those
subject to it answer for their performance.
A vague regulation can be used to keep those
subject to it in subordinate positions.
Employees usually consider speciﬁc regulations
to be fairer than vague regulations.
