The accumulation of scientiﬁc knowledge
regarding the environmental impact of oil well
drilling in North America has tended to lag behind
the actual drilling of oil wells. Most attempts to
regulate the industry have relied on hindsight: the
need for regulation becomes apparent only after
undesirable events occur. The problems associated
with oil wells’ potential contamination of
groundwater—fresh water within the earth that
supplies wells and springs—provide a case in point.
When commercial drilling for oil began in North
America in the mid-nineteenth century, regulations
reﬂected the industry’s concern for the purity of the
wells’ oil. In 1893, for example, regulations were
enacted specifying well construction requirements to
protect oil and gas reserves from contamination by
fresh water. Thousands of wells were drilled in such a
way as to protect the oil, but no thought was given to
the possibility that the groundwater itself might need
protection until many drinking-water wells near the
oil well sites began to produce unpotable, oilcontaminated water.
The reason for this contamination was that
groundwater is usually found in porous and
permeable geologic formations near the earth’s
surface, whereas petroleum and unpotable saline
water reservoirs are generally found in similar
formations but at greater depths. Drilling a well
creates a conduit connecting all the formations that it
has penetrated. Consequently, without appropriate
safeguards, wells that penetrate both groundwater and
oil or saline water formations inevitably contaminate
the groundwater. Initial attempts to prevent this
contamination consisted of sealing off the
groundwater formations with some form of protective
barrier to prevent the oil ﬂowing up the well from
entering or mixing with the natural groundwater
reservoir. This method, which is still in use today,
initially involved using hollow trees to seal off the
groundwater formations; now, however, large metal
pipe casings, set in place with cement, are used.
Regulations currently govern the kinds of casing
and cement that can be used in these practices;
however, the hazards of insufﬁcient knowledge
persist. For example, the long-term stability of this

(50)

(55)

(60)

way of protecting groundwater is unknown. The
protective barrier may fail due to corrosion of the
casing by certain ﬂuids ﬂowing up the well, or
because of dissolution of the cement by these ﬂuids.
The effects of groundwater bacteria, trafﬁc vibrations,
and changing groundwater chemistry are likewise
unassessed. Further, there is no guarantee that wells
drilled in compliance with existing regulations will
not expose a need for research in additional areas: on
the west coast of North America, a major disaster
recently occurred because a well’s location was based
on a poor understanding of the area’s subsurface
geology. Because the well was drilled in a channel
accessing the ocean, not only was the area’s
groundwater completely contaminated, but widespread
coastal contamination also occurred, prompting
international concern over oil exploration and
initiating further attempts to reﬁne regulations.
Which one of the following most accurately states
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Although now recognized as undesirable,
occasional groundwater contamination by oil
and unpotable saline water is considered to be
inevitable wherever drilling for oil occurs.
Widespread coastal contamination caused by oil
well drilling in North America has prompted
international concern over oil exploration.
Hindsight has been the only reliable means
available to regulation writers responsible for
devising adequate safeguard regulations to
prevent environmental contamination associated
with oil well drilling.
The risk of environmental contamination
associated with oil well drilling continues to
exist because safeguard regulations are often
based on hindsight and less-than-sufﬁcient
scientiﬁc information.
Groundwater contamination associated with oil
well drilling is due in part to regulations
designed to protect the oil from contamination
by groundwater and not the groundwater from
contamination by oil.

The passage states which one of the following about
underground oil reservoirs?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

They are usually located in areas whose
subsurface geology is poorly understood.
They are generally less common in coastal
regions.
They are usually located in geologic formations
similar to those in which gas is found.
They are often contaminated by fresh or saline
water.
They are generally found at greater depths than
groundwater formations.

Based on the information in the passage, if a
prospective oil well drilled near a large city encounters
a large groundwater formation and a small saline water
formation, but no oil, which one of the following
statements is most likely to be true?
(A)
(B)

(C)
3.

The author’s attitude regarding oil well drilling
regulations can most accurately be described as
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

4.

cynical that future regulatory reform will occur
without international concern
satisﬁed that existing regulations are adequate to
prevent unwarranted tradeoffs between resource
collection and environmental protection
concerned that regulatory reform will not
progress until signiﬁcant undesirable events
occur
optimistic that current scientiﬁc research will
spur regulatory reform
conﬁdent that regulations will eventually be
based on accurate geologic understandings

The author uses the phrase “the hazards of insufﬁcient
knowledge” (line 44) primarily in order to refer to the
risks resulting from
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

a lack of understanding regarding the dangers to
human health posed by groundwater
contamination
a failure to comprehend the possible
consequences of drilling in complex geologic
systems
poorly tested methods for verifying the safety of
newly developed technologies
an inadequate appreciation for the difﬁculties of
enacting and enforcing environmental
regulations
a rudimentary understanding of the materials
used in manufacturing metal pipe casings

(D)
(E)

Groundwater contamination is unlikely because
the well did not strike oil and hence will not
be put in operation.
Danger to human health due to groundwater
contamination is unlikely because large cities
generally have more than one source of
drinking water.
Groundwater contamination is likely unless the
well is plugged and abandoned.
Groundwater contamination is unlikely because
the groundwater formation’s large size will
safely dilute any saline water that enters it.
The risk of groundwater contamination can be
reduced if casing is set properly and monitored
routinely for breakdown.

In many bilingual communities of Puerto Rican
Americans living in the mainland United States,
people use both English and Spanish in a single
conversation, alternating between them smoothly and
frequently even within the same sentence. This
practice—called code-switching—is common in
bilingual populations. While there are some cases that
cannot currently be explained, in the vast majority of
cases subtle factors, either situational or rhetorical,
explain the use of code-switching.
Linguists say that most code-switching among
Puerto Rican Americans is sensitive to the social
contexts, which researchers refer to as domains, in
which conversations take place. The main
conversational factors inﬂuencing the occurrence of
code-switching are setting, participants, and topic.
When these go together naturally they are said to be
congruent; a set of three such congruent factors
constitutes a conversational situation. Linguists
studying the choice between Spanish and English
among a group of Puerto Rican American high school
students classiﬁed their conversational situations into
ﬁve domains: family, friendship, religion, education,
and employment. To test the effects of these domains
on code-switching, researchers developed a list of
hypothetical situations made up of two of the three
congruent factors, or of two incongruent factors,
approximating an interaction in one of the ﬁve
domains. The researchers asked the students to
determine the third factor and to choose which mix of
language—on a continuum from all English to all
Spanish—they would use in that situation. When
given two congruent factors, the students easily
supplied the third congruent factor and strongly
agreed among themselves about which mix they
would use. For instance, for the factors of participants
“parent and child” and the topic “how to be a good
son or daughter,” the congruent setting chosen was
“home” and the language mix chosen was Spanish
only. In contrast, incongruent factors such as the
participants “priest and parishioner” and the setting
“beach” yielded less agreement on the third factor of
topic and on language choice.
But situational factors do not account for all
code-switching; it occurs even when the domain
would lead one not to expect it. In these cases, one
language tends to be the primary one, while the other
is used only sparingly to achieve certain rhetorical
effects. Often the switches are so subtle that the
speakers themselves are not aware of them. This was
the case with a study of a family of Puerto Rican
Americans in another community. Family members
believed they used only English at home, but their
taped conversations occasionally contained some
Spanish, with no change in situational factors.
When asked what the presence of Spanish signiﬁed, they
commented that it was used to express certain
attitudes such as intimacy or humor more
emphatically.

(B) Relevant research conducted prior to the linguists’
work with high school students would lead one to
expect different answers from those the students
actually gave.
(C) Research conducted prior to the study of a family
of Puerto Rican Americans was thought by most
researchers to explain code-switching in all except
the most unusual or nonstandard contexts.
(D) Research suggests that people engaged in codeswitching are usually unaware of which situational

languages.
(E) Research suggests that the family of Puerto Rican
Americans does not use code-switching in

rhetorical effect.

12. Which one of the following does the passage offer as
evidence that code-switching cannot be entirely
explained by situational factors?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Linguists have observed that bilingual high
school students do not agree among themselves
as to what mix of languages they would use in
the presence of incongruent situational factors.
Code-switching sometimes occurs in
conversations whose situational factors would
be expected to involve the use of a single
language.
Bilingual people often switch smoothly between
two languages even when there is no change in
the situational context in which the
conversation takes place.
Puerto Rican Americans sometimes use Spanish
only sparingly and for rhetorical effect in the
presence of situational factors that would lead
one to expect Spanish to be the primary
language.
Speakers who engage in code-switching are
often unaware of the situational factors
inﬂuencing their choices of which language or
mix of languages to speak.

13. Which one of the following, if true, would most cast
doubt on the author’s interpretation of the study
involving the family discussed in the third paragraph?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

In a previous twelve-month study involving the
same family in their home, their conversations
were entirely in English except when
situational factors changed signiﬁcantly.
In a subsequent twelve-month study involving
the same family, a particular set of situational
factors occurred repeatedly without any
accompanying instances of code-switching.
In a subsequent twelve-month study involving
the same family, it was noted that intimacy and
humor were occasionally expressed through the
use of English expressions.
When asked about the signiﬁcance of their use
of Spanish, the family members replied in
English rather than Spanish.
Prior to their discussions with the researchers,
the family members did not describe their
occasional use of Spanish as serving to
emphasize humor or intimacy.

Reader-response theory, a type of literary theory
that arose in reaction to formalist literary criticism,
has endeavored to shift the emphasis in the
interpretation of literature from the text itself to the
contributions of readers to the meaning of a text.
According to literary critics who endorse readerresponse theory, the literary text alone renders no
meaning; it acquires meaning only when encountered
by individual readers, who always bring varying
presuppositions and ways of reading to bear on the
text, giving rise to the possibility—even probability—
of varying interpretations. This brand of criticism has
met opposition from the formalists, who study the
text alone and argue that reader-response theory can
encourage and even validate fragmented views of a
work, rather than the uniﬁed view acquired by
examining only the content of the text. However,
since no theory has a monopoly on divining meaning
from a text, the formalists’ view appears
unnecessarily narrow.
The proponents of formalism argue that their
approach is ﬁrmly grounded in rational, objective
principles, while reader-response theory lacks
standards and verges on absolute subjectivity. After
all, these, proponents argue, no author can create a
work that is packed with countless meanings. The
meaning of a work of literature, the formalists would
argue, may be obscure and somewhat arcane; yet,
however hidden it may be, the author’s intended
meaning is legible within the work, and it is the
critic’s responsibility to search closely for this
meaning. However, while a literary work is indeed
encoded in various signs and symbols that must be
translated for the work to be understood and
appreciated, it is not a map. Any complicated literary
work will invariably raise more questions than it
answers. What is needed is a method that enables the
critic to discern and make use of the rich stock of
meanings created in encounters between texts and
readers.
Emphasizing the varied presuppositions and
perceptions that readers bring to the interpretations of
a text can uncover hitherto unnoticed dimensions of
the text. In fact, many important works have received
varying interpretations throughout their existence,
suggesting that reader-based interpretations similar to
those described by reader-response theory had been
operating long before the theory’s principles were
articulated. And while in some cases critics’ textual
interpretations based on reader-response theory have
unfairly burdened literature of the past with
contemporary ideologies, legitimate additional
insights and understandings continue to emerge years
after an ostensibly deﬁnitive interpretation of a major

(55)

(60)

work has been articulated. By regarding a reader’s
personal interpretation of literary works as not only
valid but also useful in understanding the works,
reader-response theory legitimizes a wide range of
perspectives on these works and thereby reinforces
the notion of them as ﬂuid and lively forms of
discourse that can continue to support new
interpretations long after their original composition.

14. Which one of the following most accurately describes
the author’s attitude toward formalism as expressed in
the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

scholarly neutrality
grudging respect
thoughtless disregard
cautious ambivalence
reasoned dismissal

15. Which one of the following persons displays an
approach that most strongly suggests sympathy with the
principles of reader-response theory?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

a translator who translates a poem from Spanish
to English word for word so that its original
meaning is not distorted
a music critic who insists that early music can
be truly appreciated only when it is played on
original instruments of the period
a reviewer who ﬁnds in the works of a novelist
certain unifying themes that reveal the
novelist’s personal concerns and
preoccupations
a folk artist who uses conventional cultural
symbols and motifs as a way of conveying
commonly understood meanings
a director who sets a play by Shakespeare in
nineteenth-century Japan to give a new
perspective on the work

16. With which one of the following statements would the
author of the passage be most likely to agree?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Any literary theory should be seen ultimately as
limiting, since contradictory interpretations of
texts are inevitable.
A purpose of a literary theory is to broaden and
enhance the understanding that can be gained
from a work.
A literary theory should provide valid and
strictly objective methods for interpreting texts.
The purpose of a literary theory is to make clear
the intended meaning of the author of a work.
Since no literary theory has a monopoly on
meaning, a reader should avoid using theories
to interpret literature.

inferred from the information in the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

Formalists believe that responsible critics who
focus on the text alone will tend to ﬁnd the
same or similar meanings in a literary work.
Critical approaches similar to those described by
formalism had been used to interpret texts long
before the theory was articulated as such.
Formalists would not ﬁnd any meaning in a text
whose author did not intend it to have any one
particular meaning.

properly using reader-response theory when the
subtleties of the work’s social-historical context
are not available.

history and that bring additional insight to
literary study.
Reader-response theory legitimizes conﬂicting
interpretations that collectively diminish the
understanding of a work.
Reader-response theory fails to provide a uniﬁed
view of the meaning of a literary work.
Reader-response theory claims that a text cannot
have meaning without a reader.
Reader-response theory recognizes meanings in
a text that were never intended by the author.

Faculty researchers, particularly in scientiﬁc,
engineering, and medical programs, often produce
scientiﬁc discoveries and invent products or processes
that have potential commercial value. Many
institutions have invested heavily in the
administrative infrastructure to develop and exploit
these discoveries, and they expect to prosper both by
an increased level of research support and by the
royalties from licensing those discoveries having
patentable commercial applications. However,
although faculty themselves are unlikely to become
entrepreneurs, an increasing number of highly valued
researchers will be sought and sponsored by research
corporations or have consulting contracts with
commercial ﬁrms. One study of such entrepreneurship
concluded that “if universities do not provide the
ﬂexibility needed to venture into business, faculty
will be tempted to go to those institutions that are
responsive to their commercialized desires.” There is
therefore a need to consider the different intellectual
property policies that govern the commercial
exploitation of faculty inventions in order to
determine which would provide the appropriate
level of ﬂexibility.
In a recent study of faculty rights, Patricia Chew
has suggested a fourfold classiﬁcation of institutional
policies. A supramaximalist institution stakes out the
broadest claim possible, asserting ownership not only
of all intellectual property produced by faculty in the
course of their employment while using university
resources, but also for any inventions or patent rights
from faculty activities, even those involving research
sponsored by nonuniversity funders. A maximalist
institution allows faculty ownership of inventions
that do not arise either “in the course of the faculty’s
employment [or] from the faculty’s use of university
resources.” This approach, although not as allencompassing as that of the supramaximalist
university, can affect virtually all of a faculty
member’s intellectual production. A resource-provider
institution asserts a claim to faculty’s intellectual
product in those cases where “signiﬁcant use” of
university time and facilities is employed. Of course,
what constitutes signiﬁcant use of resources is a
matter of institutional judgment.
As Chew notes, in these policies “faculty rights,
including the sharing of royalties, are the result of
university benevolence and generosity. [However,
this] presumption is contrary to the common law,
which provides that faculty own their inventions.”
Others have pointed to this anomaly and, indeed, to
the uncertain legal and historical basis upon which
the ownership of intellectual property rests. Although
these issues remain unsettled, and though universities
may be overreaching due to faculty’s limited
knowledge of their rights, most major institutions
behave in the ways that maximize university
ownership and proﬁt participation.
But there is a fourth way, one that seems to be

(60)

(65)

free from these particular issues. Faculty-oriented
institutions assume that researchers own their own
intellectual products and the rights to exploit them
commercially, except in the development of public
health inventions or if there is previously speciﬁed
“substantial university involvement.” At these
institutions industry practice is effectively reversed,
with the university beneﬁting in far fewer
circumstances.

22. Which one of the following most accurately
summarizes the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

While institutions expect to prosper from
increased research support and royalties from
patentable products resulting from faculty
inventions, if they do not establish clear-cut
policies governing ownership of these
inventions, they run the risk of losing faculty
to research corporations or commercial
consulting contracts.
The fourfold classiﬁcation of institutional
policies governing exploitation of faculty
inventions is sufﬁcient to categorize the variety
of steps institutions are taking to ensure that
faculty inventors will not be lured away by
commercial ﬁrms or research corporations.
To prevent the loss of faculty to commercial
ﬁrms or research corporations, institutions will
have to abandon their insistence on retaining
maximum ownership of and proﬁt from faculty
inventions and adopt the common-law
presumption that faculty alone own their
inventions.
While the policies of most institutions governing
exploitation of faculty inventions seek to
maximize university ownership of and proﬁt
from these inventions, another policy offers
faculty greater ﬂexibility to pursue their
commercial interests by regarding faculty as
the owners of their intellectual products.
Most institutional policies governing
exploitation of faculty inventions are
indefensible because they run counter to
common-law notions of ownership and
copyright, but they usually go unchallenged
because few faculty members are aware of
what other options might be available to them.

inventors against encroachment by the
institutions that employ them

study institutional policies governing ownership
of faculty inventions

be better off working for commercial ﬁrms

28. The passage suggests each of the following EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Supramaximalist institutions run the greatest
risk of losing faculty to jobs in institutions more
responsive to the inventor’s ﬁnancial interests.
A faculty-oriented institution will make no
claim of ownership to a faculty invention that
is unrelated to public health and created
without university involvement.
Faculty at maximalist institutions rarely produce
inventions outside the institution without using
the institution’s resources.
There is little practical difference between the
policies of supramaximalist and maximalist
institutions.
The degree of ownership claimed by a resourceprovider institution of the work of its faculty
will not vary from case to case.

25 Questions

Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.

Pettengill: Bebop jazz musicians showed their distaste
for jazz classics by taking great liberties with
them, as though the songs could be made
interesting only through radical reshaping.
Romney: Only compelling, versatile songs can stand
such radical reshaping. Bebop musicians
recognized this and their revolutionary approach
to the jazz classics enabled them to discover
previously unknown depths in the music.
Pettengill and Romney disagree over whether
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

2.

bebop jazz was radically different from the jazz
music that preceded it
bebop jazz was an improvement on the jazz
classics that preceded it
bebop musicians showed appreciation for jazz
classics in radically reshaping them
jazz music requires musicians to adhere closely
to the original version in order to be widely
popular
bebop musicians were inﬂuenced by the more
conservative styles of their predecessors

Essayist: Earth is a living organism, composed of
other organisms much as animals are composed
of cells, not merely a thing upon which creatures
live. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that,
like all organisms, Earth can be said to have a
metabolism and to regulate its temperature,
humidity, and other characteristics, divorced from
the inﬂuences of its surroundings. Of course,
Earth does not literally breathe, but neither do
insects (they have no lungs), though they respire
successfully.
The assertion that insects do not literally breathe plays
which one of the following roles in the essayist’s
argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

a reason for not rejecting Earth’s status as an
organism on the basis of its not breathing
a reason for rejecting as false the belief that
Earth is a living organism
an illustration of the general claim that to be an
organism, a creature must have a metabolism
an example of a type of organism whose status,
like Earth’s, is unclear
an illustration of a type of organism out of
which Earth is composed

Cognitive psychologist: In a recent survey, citizens of
Country F were asked to state which one of the
following two scenarios they would prefer: (1)
Country F is the world economic leader, with a
gross national product (GNP) of $100 billion, and
Country G is second, with a GNP of $90 billion;
or (2) Country G is the economic leader, with a
GNP of $120 billion, and Country F is second,
with a GNP of $110 billion. Despite the fact that,
under scenario 2, Country F would have a higher
GNP than under scenario 1, the majority of
respondents stated that they preferred scenario 1.
Which one of the following, if true, would most help to
explain the survey results described by the cognitive
psychologist?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Most citizens of Country F believe their country
has a higher economic growth rate than
Country G.
Most citizens of Country F want their country to
have a GNP higher than $120 billion.
Most citizens of Country F believe that their
personal welfare is unconnected to GNP.
Most citizens of Country F believe GNP is a
poor measure of a nation’s economic health.
Most citizens of Country F want their country
to be more economically powerful than
Country G.

A study claims that the average temperature on Earth
has permanently increased, because the average
temperature each year for the last ﬁve years has been
higher than any previous yearly average on record.
However, periods of up to ten years of average
temperatures that have consistently been record highs
are often merely part of the random ﬂuctuations in
temperature that are always occurring.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

5.

All large increases in average temperature on
record have occurred in ten-year periods.
Five successive years of increasing annual
average temperature does not always signify a
permanent increase in temperature.
Record high temperatures can be expected on
Earth for another ﬁve years.
Random ﬂuctuations in Earth’s average
temperature typically last less than ten years.
The average temperature on Earth never
increases except in cases of random
temperature ﬂuctuation.

Shipping Coordinator: If we send your shipment by
air express, it will arrive tomorrow morning. If we
send your shipment via ground carrier, it will
arrive either tomorrow or the next day. Ground
carrier is less expensive than air express, so
which do you prefer?
Customer: If I don’t choose air express, then I will not
receive my shipment tomorrow, so I clearly have
no choice but to spend the extra money and have
it sent via air express.
The customer’s response can best be explained on the
assumption that she has misinterpreted the shipping
coordinator to mean which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Ground carrier is as reliable a shipping method
as air express.
If the shipment is sent by air express, it will
arrive tomorrow.
Ground carrier is not more expensive than air
express.
Unless the shipment is sent by air express, it
will not arrive tomorrow.
The greater the shipping cost, the faster the
shipment will arrive.

Therapists who treat violent criminals cannot both
respect their clients’ right to conﬁdentiality and be
sincerely concerned for the welfare of victims of future
violent crimes. Reporting a client’s unreported crimes
violates the client’s trust, but remaining silent leaves
the dangerous client out of prison, free to commit more
crimes.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Most therapists who treat violent criminals are
assigned this task by a judicial body.
Criminals are no more likely to receive therapy
in prison than they are out of prison.
Victims of future violent crimes also have a
right to conﬁdentiality should they need
therapy.
The right of victims of violent crimes to
compensation is as important as the right of
criminals in therapy to conﬁdentiality.
A therapist who has gained a violent criminal’s
trust can persuade that criminal not to commit
repeat offenses.

Failure to rotate crops depletes the soil’s nutrients
gradually unless other preventive measures are taken.
If the soil’s nutrients are completely depleted, additional
crops cannot be grown unless fertilizer is applied to the
soil. All other things being equal, if vegetables are
grown in soil that has had fertilizer applied rather than
being grown in non-fertilized soil, they are more
vulnerable to pests and, as a consequence, must be
treated with larger amounts of pesticides. The more
pesticides used on vegetables, the greater the health
risks to humans from eating those vegetables.
Suppose there were some vegetables that were grown
in soil to which fertilizer had never been applied. On
the basis of the passage, which one of the following
would have to be true regarding those vegetables?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

8.

The soil in which the vegetables were grown
may have been completely depleted of
nutrients because of an earlier failure to rotate
crops.
It is not possible that the vegetables were grown
in soil in which crops had been rotated.
The vegetables were grown in soil that had not
been completely depleted of nutrients but not
necessarily soil in which crops had been
rotated.
Whatever the health risks to humans from eating
the vegetables, these risks would not be
attributable to the use of pesticides on them.
The health risks to humans from eating the
vegetables were no less than the health risks to
humans from eating the same kinds of
vegetables treated with pesticides.

Criminologist: Increasing the current prison term for
robbery will result in no signiﬁcant effect in
discouraging people from committing robbery.
Each of the following, if true, supports the
criminologist’s claim EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Many people who rob are motivated primarily
by thrill-seeking and risk-taking.
An increase in the prison term for
embezzlement did not change the rate at which
that crime was committed.
Prison terms for robbery have generally
decreased in length recently.
Most people committing robbery believe that
they will not get caught.
Most people committing robbery have no idea
what the average sentence for robbery is.

Activist: As electronic monitoring of employees
grows more commonplace and invasive, we hear
more and more attempted justiﬁcations of this
practice by employers. Surveillance, they explain,
keeps employees honest, efﬁcient, and polite to
customers. Such explanations are obviously selfserving, and so should not be taken to justify these
unwarranted invasions of privacy.
A questionable technique used in the activist’s
argument is to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

attack an argument different from that actually
offered by the employers
presume that employees are never dishonest,
inefﬁcient, or rude
insist that modern business practices meet moral
standards far higher than those accepted in the
past
attack employers’ motives instead of addressing
their arguments
make a generalization based on a sample that
there is reason to believe is biased

10. When students receive negative criticism generated by
computer programs, they are less likely to respond
positively than when the critic is a human. Since the
acceptance of criticism requires that one respond
positively to it, students are more likely to learn from
criticism by humans than from criticism by computers.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Students are more likely to learn from criticism
that they accept than from criticism they do not
accept.
Unlike human critics, computers are incapable
of showing compassion.
Students always know whether their critics are
computers or humans.
Criticism generated by computers is likely to be
less favorable than that produced by human
critics in response to the same work.
Criticism generated by computers is likely to be
no more or less favorable than that produced
by human critics in response to the same work.

11. After examining the options, the budget committee
discovered that QI’s ofﬁce-phone system would be
inexpensive enough to be within the cost limit that had
been set for the committee. However, Corelink’s
system must also be inexpensive enough to be within
the limit, since it is even less expensive than QI’s
system.
The reasoning in the argument above is most closely
paralleled by that in which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Marissa is just tall enough that she can touch
the ceiling when she jumps as high as she can,
and since Jeff is taller than Marissa, he too
must be able to touch the ceiling when he
jumps.
By reducing the number of cigarettes she
smoked per day, Kate was able to run ﬁve
miles, and since Lana smokes fewer cigarettes
per day than Kate now does, she too must be
able to run ﬁve miles.
John’s blood-alcohol level was far above the
legal limit for driving, so even if it turns out
that Paul’s blood-alcohol level was lower than
John’s, it too must have been above the legal
limit.
This chocolate is not quite dark enough for it to
be the kind that Luis really likes, but that
chocolate over there is darker, so it might be
just right.
Health Dairy’s sharp cheddar cheese is low
enough in fat to meet the labeling standard for
“low fat” cheddar cheese, and since its mild
cheddar cheese is even lower in fat, it too must
meet the labeling standard.

12. Essayist: People once believed that Earth was at the
center of the universe, and that, therefore, Earth
and its inhabitants were important. We now know
that Earth revolves around a star at the outskirts
of a spiral arm of one of countless galaxies.
Therefore, people’s old belief that Earth and its
inhabitants were important was false.
A ﬂaw in the essayist’s argument is that the argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
only true statements can have good reasons to
be believed
neglects to consider that a statement that was
believed for questionable reasons may
nevertheless have been true
fails to consider that there can be no reason for
disbelieving a true statement
overlooks the fact that people’s perception of
their importance changed from century to
century
neglects the fact that people’s perception of
their importance varies from culture to culture

13. Davis: The only relevant factor in determining
appropriate compensation for property damage or
theft is the value the property loses due to
damage or the value of the property stolen; the
harm to the victim is directly proportional to the
pertinent value.
Higuchi: I disagree. More than one factor must be
considered: A victim who recovers the use of
personal property after two years is owed more
than a victim who recovers its use after only one
year.
Davis’s and Higuchi’s statements most strongly support
the view that they would disagree with each other
about which one of the following?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is possible to consistently and reliably
determine the amount of compensation owed to
someone whose property was damaged or
stolen.
Some victims are owed increased compensation
because of the greater dollar value of the
damage done to their property.
Victims who are deprived of their property are
owed compensation in proportion to the harm
they have suffered.
Some victims are owed increased compensation
because of the greater amount of time they are
deprived of the use of their property.
The compensation owed to victims should be
determined on a case-by-case basis rather than
by some general rule.

14. Resident: Residents of this locale should not consider
their loss of farming as a way of life to be a
tragedy. When this area was a rural area it was
economically depressed, but it is now a growing
bastion of high-tech industry with high-wage
jobs, and supports over 20 times the number of
jobs it did then.
Which one of the following, if true, does the most to
justify the conclusion of the resident’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Farming is becoming increasingly efﬁcient, with
the result that fewer farms are required to
produce the same amount of food.
The development of high-tech industry is more
valuable to national security than is farming.
Residents of this locale do not value a rural way
of life more than they value economic
prosperity.
Many residents of this locale have annual
incomes that are twice what they were when
the locale was primarily agricultural.
The loss of a family farm is often perceived as
tragic even when no ﬁnancial hardship results.

15. Kendrick: Governments that try to prevent cigarettes
from being advertised are justiﬁed in doing so,
since such advertisements encourage people to
engage in an unhealthy practice. But cigarette
advertisements should remain legal since
advertisements for fatty foods are legal, even
though those advertisements also encourage
people to engage in unhealthy practices.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent conﬂict between Kendrick’s
statements?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Any advertisement that encourages people to
engage in an unhealthy practice should be
made illegal, even though the legality of some
such advertisements is currently
uncontroversial.
The advertisement of fattening foods, unlike
that of cigarettes, should not be prevented,
because fattening foods, unlike cigarettes, are
not addictive.
Most advertisements should be legal, although
advertisers are always morally responsible for
ensuring that their advertisements do not
encourage people to engage in unhealthy
practices.
Governments should try to prevent the
advertisement of cigarettes by means of
ﬁnancial disincentives rather than by legal
prohibition.
Governments should place restrictions on
cigarette advertisements so as to keep them
from encouraging people to engage in
unhealthy practices, but should not try to
prevent such advertisements.

16. Environmentalist: Many people prefer to live in
regions of natural beauty. Such regions often
experience an inﬂux of new residents, and a
growing population encourages businesses to
relocate to those regions. Thus, governmentally
mandated environmental protection in regions of
natural beauty can help those regions’ economies
overall, even if such protection harms some older
local industries.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the environmentalist’s argument depends?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Regions of natural beauty typically are
beautiful enough to attract new residents only
until governmentally mandated environmental
protection that damages local industries is
imposed.
The economies of most regions of natural beauty
are not based primarily on local industries that
would be harmed by governmentally mandated
environmental protection.
If governmentally mandated environmental
protection helps a region’s economy, it does so
primarily by encouraging people to move into
that region.
Voluntary environmental protection usually does
not help a region’s economy to the degree that
governmentally mandated protection does.
A factor harmful to some older local industries
in a region need not discourage other businesses
from relocating to that region.

hemisphere have permanent seats on the United Nations
Security Council. Each of the ﬁve countries with a

of increased international peacekeeping efforts and
a greater role for the United Nations in moderating
regional disputes. However, some countries that are in
favor of increased international peacekeeping efforts are

Some small countries do not want the United
Nations to increase its spending on refugees.
Some countries in the southern hemisphere are
not in favor of increased international

Some countries that are in favor of a greater
role for the United Nations in moderating

18. Editorial: It is clear that what is called “health
education” is usually propaganda rather than
education. Propaganda and education are never
the same thing. The former is nothing but an
attempt to inﬂuence behavior through the
repetition of simplistic slogans, whereas the latter
never involves such a method. Though education
does attempt to inﬂuence behavior, it does so by
offering information in all its complexity, leaving
it up to the individual to decide how to act on
that information. Sadly, however, propaganda is
much more successful than education.
The conclusion drawn by the editorial follows logically
if it is assumed that what is called “health education”
usually
(A)

does not leave it up to the individual to decide
how to act on information
does not offer information in all its complexity

19. Marc: The fact that the people of our country look
back on the past with a great deal of nostalgia
demonstrates that they regret the recent
revolution.
Robert: They are not nostalgic for the recent past, but
for the distant past, which the prerevolutionary
regime despised; this indicates that although they
are troubled, they do not regret the revolution.
Their dialogue provides the most support for the claim
that Marc and Robert agree that the people of their
country

tend to underrate past problems when the
country faces troubling times
are looking to the past for solutions to the
country’s current problems

to the country’s past for solutions to current
problems
are concerned about the country’s current
situation and this is evidenced by their
nostalgia
tend to be most nostalgic for the things that are
the farthest in their past

20. Social critic: One of the most important ways in
which a society socializes children is by making
them feel ashamed of their immoral behavior. But
in many people this shame results in deep feelings
of guilt and self-loathing that can be a severe
hardship. Thus, moral socialization has had a net
effect of increasing the total amount of suffering.
The social critic’s argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that it
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

overlooks the possibility that the purported
source of a problem could be modiﬁed to
avoid that problem without being eliminated
altogether
fails to address adequately the possibility that
one phenomenon may causally contribute to
the occurrence of another, even though the two
phenomena do not always occur together
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
a phenomenon that supposedly increases the
total amount of suffering in a society should
therefore be changed or eliminated, regardless
of its beneﬁcial consequences
takes for granted that a behavior that sometimes
leads to a certain phenomenon cannot also
signiﬁcantly reduce the overall occurrence of
that phenomenon
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
if many people have a negative psychological
reaction to a phenomenon, then no one can have
a positive reaction to that phenomenon

story on the reaction of local residents to our
controversial art exhibit. They quoted the
responses of three residents, all of whom
expressed a sense of moral outrage. These
quotations were intended to suggest that most
local residents oppose the exhibit; the story failed
to mention, however, the fact that the three

23. Toxicologist: Recent research has shown that dioxin
causes cancer in rats. Although similar research
has never been done on humans, and probably
never will be, the use of dioxin should be

That dioxin causes cancer in rats ﬁgures in the
argument in which one of the following ways?

It is misleading to present the opinions of people
with no special expertise on a subject as though

It is misleading to present the opinions of
people on only one side of an issue when the
population is likely to be evenly divided on that
issue.
It is misleading to present the opinions of a few
people as evidence of what the majority thinks
unless the opinions they express are widely
held.
It is misleading to present testimony from close
friends and thereby imply that they must agree
with each other.
It is misleading to present the opinions of a
potentially nonrepresentative sample of people
as if they represent public opinion.

If the statements above are true, then which one of the
following must be true?
(A)
(B)

Some parrots that can learn to speak are sweet

If a parrot is not native to Australia, then it will

24. Politician: The law should not require people to wear
seat belts in cars. People are allowed to ride
motorcycles without seat belts, and riding a
motorcycle even while wearing a seat belt would
be more dangerous than riding in a car without
wearing one.
Which one of the following arguments is most similar
in its ﬂawed reasoning to the politician’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Marielle and Pat should allow their children to
have snacks between meals. They currently
allow their children to have a large dessert
after dinner, and allowing them to have snacks
between meals instead would improve their
nutrition.
Any corporation should allow its employees to
take time off when they are under too much
stress to concentrate on their work. Some
corporations allow any employee with a bad
cold to take time off, and even a healthy
employee under stress may be less productive
than an unstressed employee with a bad cold.
Amusement parks should allow people to stand
while riding roller coasters. It is legal for people
to stand at the edges of high cliffs, and even
sitting at the edge of a high cliff is more likely
to result in a fatal fall than standing while riding
a roller coaster.
It should be illegal for anyone to smoke in a
public place, for it certainly should be illegal
to pollute public drinking water, and smoking
even in the privacy of one’s home can be more
harmful to the health of others than polluting
their water would be.
Vanessa should be allowed to let her dog run

25. Burying beetles do whatever they can to minimize the
size of their competitors’ broods without adversely
affecting their own. This is why they routinely destroy
each other’s eggs when two or more beetles inhabit the
same breeding location. Yet, after the eggs hatch, the
adults treat all of the larvae equally, sharing in the care
of the entire population.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain burying beetles’ apparently contradictory
behavior?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Burying beetles whose eggs hatch before their
competitors’ are more likely to have large
broods than are burying beetles whose eggs
hatch later.
The cooperation among adult burying beetles
ensures that the greatest possible number of
larvae survive.
Burying beetles are unable to discriminate
between their own larvae and the larvae of other
burying beetles.
Many of the natural enemies of burying
beetles can be repelled only if burying beetles
cooperate in defending the breeding site.
Most breeding sites for burying beetles can
accommodate only a limited number of larvae.

Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that

1.

The development of new inventions is promoted by the
granting of patent rights, which restrict the right of
anyone but the patent holders to proﬁt from these
inventions for a speciﬁed period. Without patent rights,
anyone could simply copy another’s invention;
consequently, inventors would have no ﬁnancial
incentive for investing the time and energy required to
develop new products. Thus, it is important to continue
to grant patent rights, or else no one will engage in
original development and consequently no new
inventions will be forthcoming.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Financial reward is the only incentive that will
be effective in motivating people to develop
new inventions.
When an inventor sells patent rights to a
manufacturer, the manufacturer makes less total
proﬁt on the invention than the inventor does.
Any costs incurred by a typical inventor in
applying for patent rights are insigniﬁcant in
comparison to the ﬁnancial beneﬁt of holding
the patent rights.
Patent rights should be granted only if an
inventor’s product is not similar to another
invention already covered by patent rights.
The length of a patent right is usually
proportional to the costs involved in inventing
the product.

The Fenwicks returned home from a trip to ﬁnd two
broken bottles on their kitchen ﬂoor. There was no sign

that had free run of the house while they were away,
the Fenwicks hypothesized that they had left a back
door unlocked and that neighborhood children had
entered through it, attempted to raid the kitchen, and
left after breaking the bottles.
Each of the following, if true, helps to support the
Fenwicks’ hypothesis EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

A neighbor thought he had seen the Fenwicks’
back door closing while the Fenwicks were
away.
When the Fenwicks returned home, they found
children’s footprints on the back porch that had
not been there before their trip.
The two bottles that the Fenwicks found broken
on their kitchen ﬂoor had been in the
refrigerator when the Fenwicks left on
vacation.
There have been several recent burglaries in the
Fenwicks’ neighborhood in which
neighborhood children were suspected.
The Fenwicks returned home from their trip
later than they had planned.

People do less well on a task if they have been
told that they will be closely watched while
doing it.
People execute a task more proﬁciently when
they do not believe their abilities are being
judged.
People perform a task more proﬁciently when
they have conﬁdence in their abilities.
People who assess their talents accurately
generally perform near their actual level of
proﬁciency.
People who think that a superior performance
will please those who are testing them
generally try harder.

Sydonie: Parents differ in their beliefs about the rules
to which their children should be subject. So any
disciplinary structure in schools is bound to
create resentment because it will contradict some
parental approaches to raising children.

Art critic: The aesthetic value of a work of art lies in
its ability to impart a stimulating character to the
audience’s experience of the work.

This painting is aesthetically deﬁcient because it
is an exact copy of a painting done 30 years
ago.
This symphony is beautiful because, even
though it does not excite the audience, it is
competently performed.
This sculpted four-inch cube is beautiful
because it is carved from material which,
although much like marble, is very rare.
This painting is aesthetically valuable because it
was painted by a highly controversial artist.
This poem is aesthetically deﬁcient because it
has little impact on its audience.

Antonia: The stock market is the best place to invest
your money these days; although it is often
volatile, it provides the opportunity to make a
large proﬁt quickly.
Maria:

I agree that the stock market provides the
opportunity to make large proﬁts quickly, but one
is just as likely to take a huge loss. I think it is
better to invest in savings bonds, which provide a
constant, reliable income over many years.

Stephanie: Your conclusion is incorrect; educational
research shows that when parents list the things
that they most want their children’s schools to
provide, good discipline is always high on the
list.

Antonia’s and Maria’s statements provide the most
support for holding that they disagree about whether

Stephanie’s argument is most vulnerable to criticism on
the grounds that

(B)

(A)

(C)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

it focuses on educational research rather than
educational practice
it addresses a more general issue than that
addressed in Sydonie’s argument
it does not counter Sydonie’s suggestion that
parents have diverse ideas of what constitutes
good discipline
the phrase “high on the list” is not speciﬁc
enough to give useful information about what
parents desire from a school
it fails to discuss educators’ attitudes toward
discipline in schools

(A)

the stock market is often volatile but provides
the opportunity to make a large proﬁt quickly
savings bonds can provide a large return on
one’s investment
the stock market provides the opportunity for an
investor to make a constant, reliable income

7. Very little is known about prehistoric hominid cave
dwellers. However, a recent study of skeletons of these
hominids has revealed an important clue about their
daily activities: skeletal fractures present are most like
the type and distribution of fractures sustained by rodeo
riders. Therefore, it is likely that these cave dwellers
engaged in activities similar to rodeo riders—chasing
and tackling animals.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the argumentation above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The primary source of clues about the lives of
prehistoric hominids is their skeletal remains.
The most important aspect of prehistoric life to
be studied is how food was obtained.
If direct evidence as to the cause of a
phenomenon is available, then indirect
evidence should not be sought.
If there is a similarity between two effects, then
there is probably a similarity between their
causes.
The frequency with which a hazardous activity
is performed is proportional to the frequency of
injuries resulting from that activity.

8. Studies suggest that, for the vast majority of people
who have normal blood pressure, any amount of
sodium greater than that required by the body is simply
excreted and does not signiﬁcantly raise blood pressure.
So only persons who have high blood pressure and
whose bodies are incapable of safely processing excess
sodium need to restrict their sodium intake.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
seriously weaken the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

High blood pressure is more harmful than was
previously believed.
High blood pressure is sometimes exacerbated
by intake of more sodium than the body
requires.
Excess sodium intake over time often destroys
the body’s ability to process excess sodium.
Every human being has a physiological need for
at least some sodium.
Any sodium not used by the body will increase
blood pressure unless it is excreted.

9. Most lecturers who are effective teachers are eccentric,
but some noneccentric lecturers are very effective
teachers. In addition, every effective teacher is a good
communicator.
Which one of the following statements follows logically
from the statements above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Some good communicators are eccentric.
All good communicators are effective teachers.
Some lecturers who are not effective teachers
are not eccentric.
Most lecturers who are good communicators are
eccentric.
Some noneccentric lecturers are effective
teachers but are not good communicators.

10. Recently, photons and neutrinos emitted by a distant
supernova, an explosion of a star, reached Earth at
virtually the same time. This ﬁnding supports
Einstein’s claim that gravity is a property of space
itself, in the sense that a body exerts gravitational pull
by curving the space around it. The simultaneous
arrival of the photons and neutrinos is evidence that the
space through which they traveled was curved.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
strengthen the reasoning above?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Einstein predicted that photons and neutrinos
emitted by any one supernova would reach
Earth simultaneously.
If gravity is not a property of space itself, then
photons and neutrinos emitted simultaneously
by a distant event will reach Earth at different
times.
Photons and neutrinos emitted by distant events
would be undetectable on Earth if Einstein’s
claim that gravity is a property of space itself
were correct.
Photons and neutrinos were the only kinds of
particles that reached Earth from the
supernova.
Prior to the simultaneous arrival of photons and
neutrinos from the supernova, there was no
empirical evidence for Einstein’s claim that
gravity is a property of space itself.

11. Geneticist: Billions of dollars are spent each year on
high-proﬁle experiments that attempt to link
particular human genes with particular personality
traits. Though such experiments seem to promise
a new understanding of human nature, they have
few practical consequences. Meanwhile, more
mundane and practical genetic projects—for
example, those that look for natural ways to
make edible plants hardier or more nutritious—
are grossly underfunded. Thus, funding for
human gene research should be reduced while
funding for other genetic research should be
increased.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the geneticist’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Experiments that have the potential to help the
whole human race are more worthwhile than
those that help only a small number of people.
Experiments that focus on the genetics of plants
are more practical than those that focus on the
genetics of human nature.
Experiments that help prevent malnutrition are
more worthwhile than those that help prevent
merely undesirable personality traits.
Experiments that have modest but practical
goals are more worthwhile than those that have
impressive goals but few practical
consequences.
Experiments that get little media attention and
are not widely supported by the public are
more valuable than are those that get much
media coverage and have wide public support.

12. Some argue that because attaining governmental power
in democracies requires building majority coalitions, it
is a necessary evil that policymakers do not adhere
rigorously to principle when dealing with important
issues, but rather shift policies as they try to please
different constituents at different times. But it is
precisely this behavior that allows a democracy to
adapt more easily to serve public interests, and thus it
is more a beneﬁt than an evil.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Government policymakers cannot retain power
if they ignore any of the various factions of
their original winning coalition.
Democracies are more likely than nondemocratic
forms of government to have policymakers
who understand the complexity of
governmental issues.
In the formulation of government policy, the
advantage conferred by adaptability to diverse
or ﬂuctuating public interests outweighs the
detriment associated with a lack of strict
ﬁdelity to principle.
In dealing with an important issue, policymakers
in a democracy appeal to a principle in dealing
with an issue only when that principle has
majority support.
Democracies appear to be more ﬂexible than
nondemocratic forms of government, but are
not actually so.

13. Up until about 2 billion years ago, the sun was 30
percent dimmer than it is now. If the sun were that dim
now, our oceans would be completely frozen.
According to fossil evidence, however, life and liquid
water were both present as early as 3.8 billion years
ago.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Our atmosphere currently holds in signiﬁcantly
less heat than it did 3.8 billion years ago.
The liquid water present 3.8 billion years ago
later froze, only to melt again about 2 billion
years ago.
A signiﬁcant source of heat other than the sun
contributed to the melting of ice sheets
approximately 2 billion years ago.
Evidence suggests that certain regions of ocean
remained frozen until much more recently than
2 billion years ago.
When large portions of the globe are icecovered, more of the sun’s heat is reﬂected and
not absorbed by the earth than when only the
poles are ice-covered.

14. Social critic: The operas composed by Bizet and
Verdi are nineteenth-century European creations,
reﬂecting the attitudes and values in France and
Italy at the end of that century. Several recent
studies impugn these operas on the grounds that
they reinforce in our society many stereotypes
about women. But only a small minority of
contemporary North Americans, namely opera
lovers, have had any signiﬁcant exposure to these
works.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion that the social critic’s argument, as it is
stated above, is structured to establish?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Bizet and Verdi constructed images of women
that have signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced contemporary
stereotypes.
Nineteenth-century French and Italian images
of women are quite different from contemporary
North American images of women.
The operas of Bizet and Verdi have not
signiﬁcantly contributed to stereotypical images
of women in contemporary North America.
Opera is not an important factor shaping social
attitudes in contemporary North America.
People cannot be inﬂuenced by things they are
not directly exposed to.

15. In 1975, a province reduced its personal income tax
rate by 2 percent for most taxpayers. In 1976, the
personal income tax rate for those taxpayers was again
reduced by 2 percent. Despite the decreases in the
personal income tax rate, the total amount of money
collected from personal income taxes remained constant
from 1974 to 1975 and rose substantially in 1976.
Each of the following, if true, could help to resolve the
apparent discrepancy described above EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The years 1975 and 1976 were ones in which
the province’s economy was especially
prosperous.
The deﬁnition of “personal income” used by the
province was widened during 1975 to include
income received from personal investments.
The personal income tax rate for the wealthiest
individuals in the province rose during 1975
and 1976.
The province’s total revenue from all taxes
increased during both 1975 and 1976.
A large number of people from other provinces
moved to the province during 1975 and 1976.

16. Everything that is commonplace and ordinary fails to
catch our attention, so there are things that fail to catch
our attention but that are miracles of nature.
The conclusion of the argument follows logically if
which one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Only miracles of nature fail to be ordinary and
commonplace.
Some things that are ordinary and commonplace
are miracles of nature.
Some things that are commonplace and ordinary
fail to catch our attention.
Everything that fails to catch our attention is
commonplace and ordinary.
Only extraordinary or unusual things catch our
attention.

17. If one of the effects of a genetic mutation makes a
substantial contribution to the survival of the species,
then, and only then, will that mutation be favored in
natural selection. This process is subject to one proviso,
namely that the traits that were not favored, yet were
carried along by a trait that was favored, must not be
so negative as to annul the beneﬁts of having the new,
favored trait.

19. Today’s farmers plant only a handful of different
strains of a given crop. Crops lack the diversity that
they had only a few generations ago. Hence, a disease
that strikes only a few strains of crops, and that would
have had only minor impact on the food supply in the
past, would devastate it today.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
weaken the argument?

If the statements above are true, each of the following
could be true EXCEPT:

(A)

(A)

(B)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A species possesses a trait whose effects are all
neutral for the survival of that species.
All the effects of some genetic mutations
contribute substantially to the survival of a
species.
A species possesses a trait that reduces the
species’ survival potential.
A genetic mutation that carries along several
negative traits is favored in natural selection.
A genetic mutation whose effects are all neutral
to a species is favored in natural selection.

18. In a highly publicized kidnapping case in Ontario, the
judge barred all media and spectators from the
courtroom. Her decision was based on the judgment
that the public interest would not be served by allowing
spectators. A local citizen argued, “They pleaded with
the public to help ﬁnd the victim; they pleaded with the
public to provide tips; they aroused the public interest,
then they claimed that allowing us to attend would not
serve the public interest. These actions are
inconsistent.”
The reasoning in the local citizen’s argument is ﬂawed
because this argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

generalizes from an atypical case
trades on an ambiguity with respect to the term
“public interest”
overlooks the fact that the judge might not be
the one who made the plea to the public for
help
attempts to support its conclusion by making
sensationalistic appeals
presumes that the public’s right to know is
obviously more important than the defendant’s
right to a fair trial

(C)
(D)
(E)

In the past, crop diseases would often devastate
food supplies throughout entire regions.
Affected crops can quickly be replaced from seed
banks that store many strains of those crops.
Some of the less popular seed strains that were
used in the past were more resistant to many
diseases than are the strains popular today.
Humans today have more variety in their diets
than in the past, but still rely heavily on cereal
crops like rice and wheat.
Today’s crops are much less vulnerable to
damage from insects or encroachment by weeds
than were crops of a few generations ago.

20. Interviewer: A certain company released a model of
computer whose microprocessor design was
ﬂawed, making that computer liable to process
information incorrectly. How did this happen?
Industry spokesperson: Given the huge number of
circuits in the microprocessor of any modern
computer, not every circuit can be manually
checked before a computer model that contains
the microprocessor is released.
Interviewer: Then what guarantee do we have that
new microprocessors will not be similarly ﬂawed?
Industry spokesperson: There is no chance of further
microprocessor design ﬂaws, since all
microprocessors are now entirely computer
designed.
The industry spokesperson’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
the microprocessor quality-control procedures
of the company mentioned are not representative
of those followed throughout the industry
ignores the possibility that a microprocessor can
have a ﬂaw other than a design ﬂaw
overlooks the possibility that a new computer
model is liable to malfunction for reasons other
than a microprocessor ﬂaw
treats a single instance of a microprocessor
design ﬂaw as evidence that there will be many
such ﬂaws
takes for granted, despite evidence to the contrary,
that some computers are not liable to error

town’s annual spring cleanup received a community
recognition certiﬁcate. Because the spring cleanup took
place at the same time as the downtown arts fair, we
know that there are at least some spring cleanup
participants who are not active in the town’s artistic
circles.
If the statements above are true, which one of the
following must be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)

Some of the persons who are active in the
town’s artistic circles received community
recognition certiﬁcates.
Not all of those who received community
recognition certiﬁcates are active in the town’s

No person who received a community
recognition certiﬁcate has not participated in
the spring cleanup.
Persons who are active in the town’s artistic

22. Taking advanced mathematics courses should increase
a student’s grade point average, for, as numerous
studies have shown, students who have taken one or
more advanced mathematics courses are far more likely
to have high grade point averages than students who
have not taken such courses.
The ﬂawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above
is most similar to that in which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Fur color is in large measure hereditary, for, as
many studies have shown, black cats are more
likely than others to have black kittens, and
orange cats are more likely to have orange
kittens.
Water can cause intoxication. After all, imbibing
scotch and water, whiskey and water, bourbon
and water, gin and water, and vodka and water
all cause intoxication.
Eating a diet consisting primarily of fats and
carbohydrates may cause weight gain in some
people. Studies have shown that many
overweight people eat such diets.
Buying running shoes should increase the
frequency with which a person exercises, since
those who buy two or more pairs of running
shoes each year tend to exercise more often
than those who buy at most one pair.
Reading to children at an early age should
inspire them to read on their own later, since
studies have shown that children who have not

interest in reading than children who have been
read to.

23. Each of many different human hormones can by itself
raise the concentration of glucose in the blood. The
reason for this is probably a metabolic quirk of the
brain. To see this, consider that although most human
cells can produce energy from fats and proteins, brain
cells can use only glucose. Thus, if blood glucose
levels fall too low, brain cells will rapidly starve,
leading to unconsciousness and death.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the argument above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Each of many different human hormones can by
itself raise blood glucose levels.
The reason that many different hormones
can each independently raise blood glucose
levels is probably a metabolic quirk of the brain.
Although most human cells can produce energy
from fats and proteins, brain cells can produce
energy only from glucose.
If blood glucose levels fall too low, then brain
cells starve, resulting in loss of consciousness
and death.
The reason brain cells starve if deprived of
glucose is that they can produce energy only
from glucose.

24. Human resources director: While only some recent
university graduates consider work environment
an important factor in choosing a job, they all
consider salary an important factor. Further,
whereas the only workers who consider stress
level an important factor in choosing a job are a
few veteran employees, every recent university
graduate considers vacation policy an important
factor.
If all of the statements of the human resources director
are true, then which one of the following must be true?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

All people who consider work environment an
important factor in choosing a job also
consider salary an important factor.
At least some people who consider work
environment an important factor in choosing a
job consider vacation policy an important factor
as well.
At least some veteran employees do not
consider work environment an important factor
in choosing a job.
All people who consider vacation policy an
important factor in choosing a job also
consider salary an important factor.
No one for whom salary is an important factor in
choosing a job also considers stress level an
important factor.

26. In the aftermath of the Cold War, international
relations between Cold War allies became more
difﬁcult. Leaders of previously allied nations were
required to conduct tactful economic negotiations in
order not to arouse tensions that had previously been
overlooked.
The situation described above conforms most closely to
which one of the following propositions?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

International economic competition is a greater
cause of tension than is international military
competition.
Bonds between allies are stronger when they
derive from fear of a common enemy than
when they derive from common economic
goals.
When there is a military commitment between
countries, fundamental agreement between
them on economic matters is more easily
reached.
Economic matters are considered unimportant
during periods of actual or threatened war.
A common enemy contributes to a strengthened
bond between nations, enabling them to ignore
economic tensions that would otherwise be
problematic.
