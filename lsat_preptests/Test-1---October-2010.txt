SECTION I
Time—35 minutes
27 Questions

Directions: Each set of questions in this section is based on a single passage or a pair of passages. The questions are to be answered
on the basis of what is stated or implied in the passage or pair of passages. For some of the questions, more than one of the choices
could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response that most accurately and
completely answers the question, and blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
		 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
	
(UDHR), approved by the United Nations General
	
Assembly in 1948, was the first international treaty to
	
expressly affirm universal respect for human rights.
(5) 	 Prior to 1948 no truly international standard of
	
humanitarian beliefs existed. Although Article 1 of
	
the 1945 UN Charter had been written with the
	
express purpose of obligating the UN to “encourage
	
respect for human rights and for fundamental
(10) 	 freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,
	
language, or religion,” there were members of
	
delegations from various small countries and
	
representatives of several nongovernmental
	
organizations who felt that the language of Article 1
(15) 	 was not strong enough, and that the Charter as a
	
whole did not go far enough in its efforts to
	
guarantee basic human rights. This group lobbied
	
vigorously to strengthen the Charter’s human rights
	
provisions and proposed that member states be
(20) 	 required “to take separate and joint action and to
	
co-operate with the organization for the promotion of
	
human rights.” This would have implied an obligation
	
for member states to act on human rights issues.
	
Ultimately, this proposal and others like it were not
(25) 	 adopted; instead, the UDHR was commissioned and
	drafted.
		 The original mandate for producing the document
	
was given to the UN Commission on Human Rights
	
in February 1946. Between that time and the General
(30) 	 Assembly’s final approval of the document, the
	
UDHR passed through an elaborate eight-stage
	
drafting process in which it made its way through
	
almost every level of the UN hierarchy. The articles
	
were debated at each stage, and all 30 articles were
(35) 	 argued passionately by delegates representing diverse
	
ideologies, traditions, and cultures. The document as
	
it was finally approved set forth the essential
	
principles of freedom and equality for everyone—
	
regardless of sex, race, color, language, religion,
(40) 	 political or other opinion, national or social origin,
	
property, birth or other status. It also asserted a
	
number of fundamental human rights, including
	
among others the right to work, the right to rest and
	
leisure, and the right to education.
(45) 		 While the UDHR is in many ways a progressive
	
document, it also has weaknesses, the most
	
regrettable of which is its nonbinding legal status. For
	
all its strong language and high ideals, the UDHR
	
remains a resolution of a purely programmatic nature.
(50) 	 Nevertheless, the document has led, even if belatedly,

	
	
	
	
(55) 	
	

to the creation of legally binding human rights
conventions, and it clearly deserves recognition as an
international standard-setting piece of work, as a set
of aspirations to which UN member states are
intended to strive, and as a call to arms in the name
of humanity, justice, and freedom.

1.	 By referring to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights as “purely programmatic” (line 49) in nature, the
author most likely intends to emphasize
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

the likelihood that the document will inspire
innovative government programs designed to
safeguard human rights
the ability of the document’s drafters to translate
abstract ideals into concrete standards
the compromises that went into producing a
version of the document that would garner the
approval of all relevant parties
the fact that the guidelines established by the
document are ultimately unenforceable
the frustration experienced by the document’s
drafters at stubborn resistance from within the
UN hierarchy

2.	 The author most probably quotes directly from both the
UN Charter (lines 8–11) and the proposal mentioned in
lines 20–22 for which one of the following reasons?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

to contrast the different definitions of human
rights in the two documents
to compare the strength of the human rights
language in the two documents
to identify a bureaucratic vocabulary that is
common to the two documents
to highlight what the author believes to be the
most important point in each document
to call attention to a significant difference in the
prose styles of the two documents

3.	 The author’s stance toward the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights can best be described as
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

unbridled enthusiasm
qualified approval
absolute neutrality
reluctant rejection
strong hostility

It asserts a right to rest and leisure.
It was drafted after the UN Charter was drafted.
The UN Commission on Human Rights was
charged with producing it.
It has had no practical consequences.
It was the first international treaty to explicitly
affirm universal respect for human rights.

5.	 The author would be most likely to agree with which
one of the following statements?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

The human rights language contained in Article
1 of the UN Charter is so ambiguous as to be
almost wholly ineffectual.
The weaknesses of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights generally outweigh the strengths
of the document.
It was relatively easy for the drafters of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights to reach
a consensus concerning the contents of the
document.
The drafters of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights omitted important rights that
should be included in a truly comprehensive list
of basic human rights.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
would be truer to the intentions of its staunchest
proponents if UN member countries were
required by law to abide by its provisions.

6.	 Suppose that a group of independent journalists has
uncovered evidence of human rights abuses being
perpetrated by a security agency of a UN member state
upon a group of political dissidents. Which one of the
following approaches to the situation would most likely
be advocated by present-day delegates who share the
views of the delegates and representatives mentioned in
lines 11–14?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

The UN General Assembly authenticates the
evidence and then insists upon prompt remedial
action on the part of the government of the
member state.
The UN General Assembly stipulates that
any proposed response must be unanimously
accepted by member states before it can be
implemented.
The UN issues a report critical of the actions
of the member state in question and calls for a
censure vote in the General Assembly.
The situation is regarded by the UN as an
internal matter that is best left to the discretion
of the government of the member state.
The situation is investigated further by
nongovernmental humanitarian organizations
that promise to disclose their findings to the
public via the international media.

		 It is commonly assumed that even if some
	
forgeries have aesthetic merit, no forgery has as much
	
as an original by the imitated artist would. Yet even
	
the most prominent art specialists can be duped by a
(5) 	 talented artist turned forger into mistaking an almost
	
perfect forgery for an original. For instance, artist
	
Han van Meegeren’s The Disciples at Emmaus
	
(1937)—painted under the forged signature of the
	
acclaimed Dutch master Jan Vermeer (1632–1675)—
(10) 	 attracted lavish praise from experts as one of
	
Vermeer’s finest works. The painting hung in a
	
Rotterdam museum until 1945, when, to the great
	
embarrassment of the critics, van Meegeren revealed
	
its origin. Astonishingly, there was at least one highly
(15) 	 reputed critic who persisted in believing it to be a
	
Vermeer even after van Meegeren’s confession.
		 Given the experts’ initial enthusiasm, some
	
philosophers argue that van Meegeren’s painting must
	
have possessed aesthetic characteristics that, in a
(20) 	 Vermeer original, would have justified the critics’
	
plaudits. Van Meegeren’s Emmaus thus raises difficult
	
questions regarding the status of superbly executed
	
forgeries. Is a forgery inherently inferior as art? How
	
are we justified, if indeed we are, in revising
(25) 	 downwards our critical assessment of a work
	
unmasked as a forgery? Philosopher of art Alfred
	
Lessing proposes convincing answers to these
	questions.
		 A forged work is indeed inferior as art, Lessing
(30) 	 argues, but not because of a shortfall in aesthetic
	
qualities strictly defined, that is to say, in the qualities
	
perceptible on the picture’s surface. For example, in
	
its composition, its technique, and its brilliant use of
	
color, van Meegeren’s work is flawless, even
(35) 	 beautiful. Lessing argues instead that the deficiency
	
lies in what might be called the painting’s intangible
	
qualities. All art, explains Lessing, involves
	
technique, but not all art involves origination of a
	
new vision, and originality of vision is one of the
(40) 	 fundamental qualities by which artistic, as opposed to
	
purely aesthetic, accomplishment is measured. Thus
	
Vermeer is acclaimed for having inaugurated, in the
	
seventeenth century, a new way of seeing, and for
	
pioneering techniques for embodying this new way of
(45) 	 seeing through distinctive treatment of light, color,
	
and form.
		 Even if we grant that van Meegeren, with his
	
undoubted mastery of Vermeer’s innovative
	
techniques, produced an aesthetically superior
(50) 	 painting, he did so about three centuries after
	
Vermeer developed the techniques in question.
	
Whereas Vermeer’s origination of these techniques in
	
the seventeenth century represents a truly impressive
	
and historic achievement, van Meegeren’s production
(55) 	 of The Disciples at Emmaus in the twentieth century
	
presents nothing new or creative to the history of art.
	
Van Meegeren’s forgery therefore, for all its aesthetic
	
merits, lacks the historical significance that makes
	
Vermeer’s work artistically great.	

7.	 Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

The Disciples at Emmaus, van Meegeren’s
forgery of a Vermeer, was a failure in both
aesthetic and artistic terms.
The aesthetic value of a work of art is less
dependent on the work’s visible characteristics
than on certain intangible characteristics.
Forged artworks are artistically inferior to
originals because artistic value depends in large
part on originality of vision.
The most skilled forgers can deceive even highly
qualified art experts into accepting their work as
original.
Art critics tend to be unreliable judges of the
aesthetic and artistic quality of works of art.

8.	 The passage provides the strongest support for inferring
that Lessing holds which one of the following views?
(A)	

(B)	
(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

The judgments of critics who pronounced The
Disciples at Emmaus to be aesthetically superb
were not invalidated by the revelation that the
painting is a forgery.
The financial value of a work of art depends
more on its purely aesthetic qualities than on its
originality.
Museum curators would be better off not
taking art critics’ opinions into account when
attempting to determine whether a work of art is
authentic.
Because it is such a skilled imitation of Vermeer,
The Disciples at Emmaus is as artistically
successful as are original paintings by artists
who are less significant than Vermeer.
Works of art that have little or no aesthetic value
can still be said to be great achievements in
artistic terms.

9.	 In the first paragraph, the author refers to a highly
reputed critic’s persistence in believing van Meegeren’s
forgery to be a genuine Vermeer primarily in order to
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

argue that many art critics are inflexible in their
judgments
indicate that the critics who initially praised
The Disciples at Emmaus were not as
knowledgeable as they appeared
suggest that the painting may yet turn out to be a
genuine Vermeer
emphasize that the concept of forgery itself is
internally incoherent
illustrate the difficulties that skillfully executed
forgeries can pose for art critics

lovers of a musical group contemptuously reject
a tribute album recorded by various other
musicians as a second-rate imitation
art historians extol the work of a little-known
painter as innovative until it is discovered that
the painter lived much more recently than was
originally thought
diners at a famous restaurant effusively praise the
food as delicious until they learn that the master
chef is away for the night
literary critics enthusiastically applaud a new
novel until its author reveals that its central
symbols are intended to represent political
views that the critics dislike
movie fans evaluate a particular movie more
favorably than they otherwise might have
because their favorite actor plays the lead role

11.	 The passage provides the strongest support for inferring
that Lessing holds which one of the following views?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

It is probable that many paintings currently
hanging in important museums are actually
forgeries.
The historical circumstances surrounding the
creation of a work are important in assessing the
artistic value of that work.
The greatness of an innovative artist depends
on how much influence he or she has on other
artists.
The standards according to which a work is
judged to be a forgery tend to vary from one
historical period to another.
An artist who makes use of techniques developed
by others cannot be said to be innovative.

12.	 The passage most strongly supports which one of the
following statements?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

In any historical period, the criteria by which a
work is classified as a forgery can be a matter of
considerable debate.
An artist who uses techniques that others have
developed is most likely a forger.
A successful forger must originate a new artistic
vision.
Works of art created early in the career of a great
artist are more likely than those created later to
embody historic innovations.
A painting can be a forgery even if it is not a
copy of a particular original work of art.

13.	 Which one of the following, if true, would most
strengthen Lessing’s contention that a painting can
display aesthetic excellence without possessing an
equally high degree of artistic value?
(A)	
(B)	

(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

Many of the most accomplished art forgers have
had moderately successful careers as painters of
original works.
Reproductions painted by talented young artists
whose traditional training consisted in the
copying of masterpieces were often seen as
beautiful, but never regarded as great art.
While experts can detect most forgeries, they
can be duped by a talented forger who knows
exactly what characteristics experts expect to
find in the work of a particular painter.
Most attempts at art forgery are ultimately
unsuccessful because the forger has not
mastered the necessary techniques.
The criteria by which aesthetic excellence is
judged change significantly from one century to
another and from one culture to another.

scenarios is most analogous to the reaction of the art
critics mentioned in line 13?

Test 1

Passage A
		 One function of language is to influence others’
	
behavior by changing what they know, believe, or
	
desire. For humans engaged in conversation, the
	
perception of another’s mental state is perhaps the
(5) 	 most common vocalization stimulus.
		 While animal vocalizations may have evolved
	
because they can potentially alter listeners’ behavior to
	
the signaler’s benefit, such communication is—in
	
contrast to human language—inadvertent, because
(10) 	 most animals, with the possible exception of chimpanzees,
	
cannot attribute mental states to others. The male
	Physalaemus frog calls because calling causes females
	
to approach and other males to retreat, but there is no
	
evidence that he does so because he attributes knowledge
(15) 	 or desire to other frogs, or because he knows his calls
	
will affect their knowledge and that this knowledge
	
will, in turn, affect their behavior. Research also suggests
	
that, in marked contrast to humans, nonhuman primates
	
do not produce vocalizations in response to perception
(20) 	 of another’s need for information. Macaques, for example,
	
give alarm calls when predators approach and coo calls
	
upon finding food, yet experiments reveal no evidence
	
that individuals were more likely to call about these
	
events when they were aware of them but their offspring
(25) 	 were clearly ignorant; similarly, chimpanzees do not
	
appear to adjust their calling to inform ignorant
	
individuals of their own location or that of food. Many
	
animal vocalizations whose production initially seems
	
goal-directed are not as purposeful as they first appear.
Passage B
(30) 		 Many scientists distinguish animal communication
	
systems from human language on the grounds that the
	
former are rigid responses to stimuli, whereas human
	
language is spontaneous and creative.
		 In this connection, it is commonly stated that no
(35) 	 animal can use its communication system to lie.
	
Obviously, a lie requires intention to deceive: to judge
	
whether a particular instance of animal communication
	
is truly prevarication requires knowledge of the animal’s
	
intentions. Language philosopher H. P. Grice explains
(40) 	 that for an individual to mean something by uttering x,
	
the individual must intend, in expressing x, to induce
	
an audience to believe something and must also intend
	
the utterance to be recognized as so intended. But
	
conscious intention is a category of mental experience
(45) 	 widely believed to be uniquely human. Philosopher
	
Jacques Maritain’s discussion of the honeybee’s
	
elaborate “waggle-dance” exemplifies this view.
	
Although bees returning to the hive communicate to
	
other bees the distance and direction of food sources,
(50) 	 such communication is, Maritain asserts, merely a
	
conditioned reflex: animals may use communicative
	
signs but lack conscious intention regarding their use.
		 But these arguments are circular: conscious
	
intention is ruled out a priori and then its absence
(55) 	 taken as evidence that animal communication is
	
fundamentally different from human language. In fact,
	
the narrowing of the perceived gap between animal
	
communication and human language revealed by

	
(60) 	
	
	
	
	
(65) 	

recent research with chimpanzees and other animals
calls into question not only the assumption that the
difference between animal and human communication
is qualitative rather than merely quantitative, but also
the accompanying assumption that animals respond
mechanically to stimuli, whereas humans speak with
conscious understanding and intent.

14.	 Both passages are primarily concerned with addressing
which one of the following questions?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Are animals capable of deliberately prevaricating
in order to achieve specific goals?
Are the communications of animals
characterized by conscious intention?
What kinds of stimuli are most likely to elicit
animal vocalizations?
Are the communication systems of nonhuman
primates qualitatively different from those of all
other animals?
Is there a scientific consensus about the
differences between animal communication
systems and human language?

15.	 In discussing the philosopher Maritain, the author of
passage B seeks primarily to
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

describe an interpretation of animal
communication that the author believes rests on
a logical error

intention underlying the communicative signs
employed by certain animals
present an argument in support of the view that
animal communication systems are spontaneous
and creative

that most animal communication is merely a

communication whose views the author regards

They fail to recognize that humans often
communicate without any clear idea of their
listeners’ mental states.
Most of them lack the credentials needed to
assess the relevant experimental evidence
correctly.
They ignore well-known evidence that animals
do in fact practice deception.
They make assumptions about matters that
should be determined empirically.
They falsely believe that all communication
systems can be explained in terms of their
evolutionary benefits.

17.	 Which one of the following assertions from passage A
provides support for the view attributed to Maritain in
passage B (lines 50–52)?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

One function of language is to influence the
behavior of others by changing what they think.
Animal vocalizations may have evolved because
they have the potential to alter listeners’
behavior to the signaler’s benefit.
It is possible that chimpanzees may have the
capacity to attribute mental states to others.
There is no evidence that the male Physalaemus
frog calls because he knows that his calls will
affect the knowledge of other frogs.
Macaques give alarm calls when predators
approach and coo calls upon finding food.

the extent to which communication among
humans involves the ability to perceive the
mental states of others
the importance of determining to what extent

mental states to others

		 In contrast to the mainstream of U.S.
	
historiography during the late nineteenth and early
	
twentieth centuries, African American historians of
	
the period, such as George Washington Williams and
(5) 	 W. E. B. DuBois, adopted a transnational perspective.
	
This was true for several reasons, not the least of
	
which was the necessity of doing so if certain aspects
	
of the history of African Americans in the United
	
States were to be treated honestly.
(10) 		 First, there was the problem of citizenship. Even
	
after the adoption in 1868 of the Fourteenth
	
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which defined
	
citizenship, the question of citizenship for African
	
Americans had not been genuinely resolved. Because
(15) 	 of this, emigrationist sentiment was a central issue in
	
black political discourse, and both issues were critical
	
topics for investigation. The implications for historical
	
scholarship and national identity were enormous. While
	
some black leaders insisted on their right to U.S.
(20) 	 citizenship, others called on black people to emigrate
	
and find a homeland of their own. Most African
	
Americans were certainly not willing to relinquish
	
their claims to the benefits of U.S. citizenship, but many
	
had reached a point of profound pessimism and had
(25) 	 begun to question their allegiance to the United States.
		 Mainstream U.S. historiography was firmly rooted
	
in a nationalist approach during this period; the
	
glorification of the nation and a focus on the
	
nation-state as a historical force were dominant. The
(30) 	 expanding spheres of influence of Europe and the
	
United States prompted the creation of new
	
genealogies of nations, new myths about the
	
inevitability of nations, their “temperaments,” their
	
destinies. African American intellectuals who
(35) 	 confronted the nationalist approach to historiography
	
were troubled by its implications. Some argued that
	
imperialism was a natural outgrowth of nationalism
	
and its view that a state’s strength is measured by the
	
extension of its political power over colonial territory;
(40) 	 the scramble for colonial empires was a distinct
	
aspect of nationalism in the latter part of the
	
nineteenth century.
		 Yet, for all their distrust of U.S. nationalism, most
	
early black historians were themselves engaged in a
(45) 	 sort of nation building. Deliberately or not, they
	
contributed to the formation of a collective identity,
	
reconstructing a glorious African past for the
	
purposes of overturning degrading representations of
	
blackness and establishing a firm cultural basis for a
(50) 	 shared identity. Thus, one might argue that black
	
historians’ internationalism was a manifestation of a
	
kind of nationalism that posits a diasporic community,
	
which, while lacking a sovereign territory or official
	
language, possesses a single culture, however
(55) 	 mythical, with singular historical roots. Many
	
members of this diaspora saw themselves as an
	
oppressed “nation” without a homeland, or they
	
imagined Africa as home. Hence, these historians
	
understood their task to be the writing of the history
(60) 	 of a people scattered by force and circumstance, a
	
history that began in Africa.

20.	 Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main idea of the passage?
(A)	

(B)	
(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

Historians are now recognizing that the major
challenge faced by African Americans in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was the
struggle for citizenship.
Early African American historians who practiced a
transnational approach to history were primarily
interested in advancing an emigrationist project.
U.S. historiography in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries was characterized by
a conflict between African American historians
who viewed history from a transnational
perspective and mainstream historians who took
a nationalist perspective.
The transnational perspective of early African
American historians countered mainstream
nationalist historiography, but it was arguably
nationalist itself to the extent that it posited a
culturally unified diasporic community.
Mainstream U.S. historians in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries could no longer
justify their nationalist approach to history once
they were confronted with the transnational
perspective taken by African American historians.

conveys the sense of the word “reconstructing” as it is
used in line 47?

22.	 Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the passage?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

Emigrationist sentiment would not have been
as strong among African Americans in the late
nineteenth century had the promise of U.S.
citizenship been fully realized for African
Americans at that time.
Scholars writing the history of diasporic
communities generally do not discuss the
forces that initially caused the scattering of the
members of those communities.
Most historians of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries endeavored to make the
histories of the nations about which they wrote
seem more glorious than they actually were.
To be properly considered nationalist, a historical
work must ignore the ways in which one nation’s
foreign policy decisions affected other nations.
A considerable number of early African American
historians embraced nationalism and the
inevitability of the dominance of the nation-state.

examined the extent to which African American
culture at the turn of the century incorporated
traditions that were common to a number of
African cultures

24.	 The passage provides information sufficient to answer
which one of the following questions?
(A)	
(B)	

(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Which African nations did early African American
historians research in writing their histories of the
African diaspora?
What were some of the African languages spoken
by the ancestors of the members of the African
diasporic community who were living in the
United States in the late nineteenth century?
Over which territories abroad did the United
States attempt to extend its political power in the
latter part of the nineteenth century?
Are there textual ambiguities in the Fourteenth
Amendment that spurred the conflict over U.S.
citizenship for African Americans?
In what ways did African American leaders
respond to the question of citizenship for African
Americans in the latter part of the nineteenth
century?

with which one of the following statements?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Members of a particular diasporic community
have a common country of origin.
Territorial sovereignty is not a prerequisite for
the project of nation building.

nationalist historiography declined to engage in
historical myth-making of any kind.
The most prominent African American historians
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
advocated emigration for African Americans.
Historians who employed a nationalist approach
focused on entirely different events from those
studied and written about by early African
American historians.

26.	 The main purpose of the second paragraph of the
passage is to
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)

explain why early African American historians
felt compelled to approach historiography in the
way that they did
show that governmental actions such as
constitutional amendments do not always have
the desired effect
support the contention that African American
intellectuals in the late nineteenth century were
critical of U.S. imperialism
establish that some African American political
leaders in the late nineteenth century advocated
emigration as an alternative to fighting for the
benefits of U.S. citizenship
argue that the definition of citizenship contained
in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution is too limited

27.	 As it is presented in the passage, the approach to
history taken by mainstream U.S. historians of the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is most
similar to the approach exemplified in which one of the
following?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

An elected official writes a memo suggesting that
because a particular course of action has been
successful in the past, the government should
continue to pursue that course of action.
A biographer of a famous novelist argues that the
precocity apparent in certain of the novelist’s
early achievements confirms that her success
was attributable to innate talent.

25 Questions

Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the
response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense
standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the
corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1.	 Mary to Jamal: You acknowledge that as the legitimate
owner of this business I have the legal right to
sell it whenever I wish. But also you claim that
because loyal employees will suffer if I sell it, I
therefore have no right to do so. Obviously, your
statements taken together are absurd.

2.	 Since there is no survival value in an animal’s having an
organ that is able to function when all its other organs
have broken down to such a degree that the animal dies,
it is a result of the efficiency of natural selection that
no organ is likely to evolve in such a way that it greatly
outlasts the body’s other organs.

	

	

	

Mary’s reasoning is most vulnerable to the criticism
that she
(A)	

(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

overlooks the possibility that when Jamal claims
that she has no right to sell the business, he
simply means she has no right to do so at this
time
overlooks the possibility that her employees also
have rights related to the sale of the business
provides no evidence for the claim that she does
have a right to sell the business
overlooks the possibility that Jamal is referring
to two different kinds of right
attacks Jamal’s character rather than his
argument

Of the following, which one illustrates a principle
that is most similar to the principle illustrated by the
passage?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

A store in a lower-income neighborhood finds
that it is unable to sell its higher-priced goods
and so stocks them only when ordered by a
customer.
The body of an animal with a deficient organ
is often able to compensate for that deficiency
when other organs perform the task the deficient
one normally performs.
One car model produced by an automobile
manufacturer has a life expectancy that is so
much longer than its other models that its great
popularity requires the manufacturer to stop
producing some of the other models.
Athletes occasionally overdevelop some parts
of their bodies to such a great extent that other
parts of their bodies are more prone to injury as
a result.
Automotive engineers find that it is not costeffective to manufacture a given automobile
part of such high quality that it outlasts all other
parts of the automobile, as doing so would not
raise the overall quality of the automobile.

Simpson: The relatively small size of the museum’s
contemporary art collection is appropriate. It’s
an art museum, not an ethnographic museum
designed to collect every style of every period.
Its contemporary art collection is small because
its curators believe that there is little high-quality
contemporary art.

	

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the reasoning in Simpson’s response to
Vandenburg?

If all of the statements above are true, then which one
of the following must be true?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

The present administration is economically
successful.
The present administration is not an overall
success.
If the present administration is economically
successful, then it is an overall success.
If the present administration had been
economically successful, it would have cared
for the environment.
If the present administration succeeds at
environmental protection, then it will be an
overall success.

4.	 The legislature is considering a proposed bill that would
prohibit fishing in Eagle Bay. Despite widespread
concern over the economic effect this ban would have
on the local fishing industry, the bill should be enacted.
The bay has one of the highest water pollution levels
in the nation, and a recent study of the bay’s fish found
that 80 percent of them contained toxin levels that
exceed governmental safety standards. Continuing
to permit fishing in Eagle Bay could thus have grave
effects on public health.
	

5.	 Vandenburg: This art museum is not adhering to its
purpose. Its founders intended it to devote as
much attention to contemporary art as to the art of
earlier periods, but its collection of contemporary
art is far smaller than its other collections.

The argument proceeds by presenting evidence that
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

the toxic contamination of fish in Eagle Bay has
had grave economic effects on the local fishing
industry
the moral principle that an action must be judged
on the basis of its foreseeable effects is usually
correct
the opponents of the ban have failed to weigh
properly its foreseeable negative effects against
its positive ones
failure to enact the ban would carry with it
unacceptable risks for the public welfare
the ban would reduce the level of toxins in the
fish in Eagle Bay

(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

An art museum should collect only works that its
curators consider to be of high artistic quality.
An art museum should not collect any works that
violate the purpose defined by the museum’s
founders.
An art museum’s purpose need not be to collect
every style of every period.
An ethnographic museum’s purpose should be
defined according to its curators’ beliefs.
The intentions of an art museum’s curators
should not determine what is collected by that
museum.

6.	 Over the last five years, every new major alternativeenergy initiative that initially was promised government
funding has since seen that funding severely curtailed.
In no such case has the government come even close
to providing the level of funds initially earmarked for
these projects. Since large corporations have made it
a point to discourage alternative-energy projects, it
is likely that the corporations’ actions influenced the
government’s funding decisions.
	

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the reasoning above?
(A)	
(B)	

(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

For the past two decades, most alternative-energy
initiatives have received little or no government
funding.
The funding initially earmarked for a government
project is always subject to change, given the
mechanisms by which the political process
operates.
The only research projects whose government
funding has been severely curtailed are those
that large corporations have made it a point to
discourage.
Some projects encouraged by large corporations
have seen their funding severely curtailed over
the last five years.
All large corporations have made it a point to
discourage some forms of research.

It is enjoyable, encourages foresight and
logical thinking, and discourages carelessness,
inattention, and impulsiveness. In short, it
promotes mental maturity.
	

	

Sklar: My objection to teaching chess to children is
that it diverts mental activity from something with
societal value, such as science, into something that
has no societal value.

9.	 Musicologist: Classification of a musical instrument
depends on the mechanical action through which
it produces music. So the piano is properly called
a percussion instrument, not a stringed instrument.
Even though the vibration of the piano’s strings
is what makes its sound, the strings are caused to
vibrate by the impact of hammers.

support for holding that they disagree with each other
over whether

Theodora: You are wrong in claiming that
vegetarianism cannot lead to nutritional
deficiencies. If most people became vegetarians,
some of those losing jobs due to the collapse

Theodora’s reply to Marcia’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that her reply
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

(A)	
(B)	

chess promotes mental maturity
many activities promote mental maturity just as
well as chess does
chess is socially valuable and science is not
children should be taught to play chess
children who neither play chess nor study
science are mentally immature

Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the musicologist’s argument?

(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Musical instruments should be classified
according to the mechanical actions through
which they produce sound.
Musical instruments should not be classified
based on the way musicians interact with them.
Some people classify the piano as a stringed
instrument because of the way the piano
produces sound.
The piano should be classified as a stringed
instrument rather than as a percussion
instrument.
It is correct to classify the piano as a percussion
instrument rather than as a stringed instrument.

10.	 In a vast ocean region, phosphorus levels have doubled
in the past few decades due to agricultural runoff
pouring out of a large river nearby. The phosphorus
stimulates the growth of plankton near the ocean
surface. Decaying plankton fall to the ocean floor,
where bacteria devour them, consuming oxygen in the
process. Due to the resulting oxygen depletion, few fish
can survive in this region.
	

Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the information above?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

The agricultural runoff pouring out of the river
contributes to the growth of plankton near the
ocean surface.
Before phosphorus levels doubled in the ocean
region, most fish were able to survive in that
region.
If agricultural runoff ceased pouring out of the
river, there would be no bacteria on the ocean
floor devouring decaying plankton.
The quantity of agricultural runoff pouring out of
the river has doubled in the past few decades.
The amount of oxygen in a body of water is in
general inversely proportional to the level of
phosphorus in that body of water.

(E)	

The more pressure most drivers feel because
others are waiting for them to perform
maneuvers with their cars, the less quickly they
are able to perform them.
The amount of time drivers spend entering a
parking space is not noticeably affected by
whether other drivers are waiting for them to
do so, nor by whether those other drivers are
honking impatiently.
It is considerably more difficult and timeconsuming for a driver to maneuver a car out of
a parking space if another car waiting to enter
that space is nearby.
Parking spaces in shopping mall parking lots are
unrepresentative of parking spaces in general
with respect to the likelihood that other cars will
be waiting to enter them.
Almost any driver leaving a parking space
will feel angry at another driver who honks
impatiently, and this anger will influence the
amount of time spent leaving the space.

12.	 Shark teeth are among the most common vertebrate
fossils; yet fossilized shark skeletons are much less
common—indeed, comparatively rare among fossilized
vertebrate skeletons.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent paradox described above?
(A)	

(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Unlike the bony skeletons of other vertebrates,
shark skeletons are composed of cartilage, and
teeth and bone are much more likely to fossilize
than cartilage is.
The rare fossilized skeletons of sharks that are
found are often found in areas other than those
in which fossils of shark teeth are plentiful.
Fossils of sharks’ teeth are quite difficult to
distinguish from fossils of other kinds of teeth.
Some species of sharks alive today grow and lose
many sets of teeth during their lifetimes.
The physical and chemical processes involved in
the fossilization of sharks’ teeth are as common
as those involved in the fossilization of shark
skeletons.

The argument’s conclusion is properly drawn if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)	

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
reasoning?
(A)	

	

13.	 Critic: Photographers, by deciding which subjects
to depict and how to depict them, express their
own worldviews in their photographs, however
realistically those photographs may represent
reality. Thus, photographs are interpretations of
reality.

(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Even representing a subject realistically can
involve interpreting that subject.
To express a worldview is to interpret reality.
All visual art expresses the artist’s worldview.
Any interpretation of reality involves the
expression of a worldview.
Nonrealistic photographs, like realistic
photographs, express the worldviews of the
photographers who take them.

14.	 Geologists recently discovered marks that closely
resemble worm tracks in a piece of sandstone. These
marks were made more than half a billion years earlier
than the earliest known traces of multicellular animal
life. Therefore, the marks are probably the traces of
geological processes rather than of worms.
	

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?
(A)	
(B)	

(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

It is sometimes difficult to estimate the precise
age of a piece of sandstone.
Geological processes left a substantial variety
of marks in sandstone more than half a billion
years before the earliest known multicellular
animal life existed.
There were some early life forms other than
worms that are known to have left marks that
are hard to distinguish from those found in the
piece of sandstone.
At the place where the sandstone was found, the
only geological processes that are likely to mark
sandstone in ways that resemble worm tracks
could not have occurred at the time the marks
were made.
Most scientists knowledgeable about early
animal life believe that worms are likely to have
been among the earliest forms of multicellular
animal life on Earth, but evidence of their
earliest existence is scarce because they are
composed solely of soft tissue.

11.	 Psychologists observing a shopping mall parking lot
found that, on average, drivers spent 39 seconds leaving
a parking space when another car was quietly waiting
to enter it, 51 seconds if the driver of the waiting car
honked impatiently, but only 32 seconds leaving a space
when no one was waiting. This suggests that drivers feel
possessive of their parking spaces even when leaving
them, and that this possessiveness increases in reaction
to indications that another driver wants the space.

physically feasible means of accomplishing a given
task, so it should be unsurprising if, like eyes or

16.	 Engineer: Thermophotovoltaic generators are devices
that convert heat into electricity. The process
of manufacturing steel produces huge amounts
of heat that currently go to waste. So if steelmanufacturing plants could feed the heat they
produce into thermophotovoltaic generators, they
would greatly reduce their electric bills, thereby
saving money.
	

Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the engineer’s argument depends?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

There is no other means of utilizing the heat
produced by the steel-manufacturing process
that would be more cost effective than installing
thermophotovoltaic generators.
Using current technology, it would be possible
for steel-manufacturing plants to feed the
heat they produce into thermophotovoltaic
generators in such a way that those generators
could convert at least some of that heat into
electricity.
The amount steel-manufacturing plants would
save on their electric bills by feeding heat
into thermophotovoltaic generators would be
sufficient to cover the cost of purchasing and
installing those generators.
At least some steel-manufacturing plants rely on
electricity as their primary source of energy in
the steel-manufacturing process.
There are at least some steel-manufacturing
plants that could greatly reduce their electricity
bills only if they used some method of
converting wasted heat or other energy from the
steel-manufacturing process into electricity.

17.	 Herbalist: While standard antibiotics typically have
just one active ingredient, herbal antibacterial
remedies typically contain several. Thus, such
herbal remedies are more likely to retain their
effectiveness against new, resistant strains of
bacteria than are standard antibiotics. For a strain
of bacteria, the difficulty of developing resistance
to an herbal antibacterial remedy is like a cook’s
difficulty in trying to prepare a single meal that
will please all of several dozen guests, a task far
more difficult than preparing one meal that will
please a single guest.
	

In the analogy drawn in the argument above, which one
of the following corresponds to a standard antibiotic?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

a single guest
several dozen guests
the pleasure experienced by a single guest
a cook
the ingredients available to a cook

18.	 To find out how barn owls learn how to determine the
direction from which sounds originate, scientists put
distorting lenses over the eyes of young barn owls
before the owls first opened their eyes. The owls with
these lenses behaved as if objects making sounds were
farther to the right than they actually were. Once the
owls matured, the lenses were removed, yet the owls
continued to act as if they misjudged the location of
the source of sounds. The scientists consequently
hypothesized that once a barn owl has developed an
auditory scheme for estimating the point from which
sounds originate, it ceases to use vision to locate
sounds.
	

The scientists’ reasoning is vulnerable to which one of
the following criticisms?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

It fails to consider whether the owls’ vision was
permanently impaired by their having worn the
lenses while immature.
It assumes that the sense of sight is equally good
in all owls.
It attributes human reasoning processes to a
nonhuman organism.
It neglects to consider how similar distorting
lenses might affect the behavior of other bird
species.
It uses as evidence experimental results that were
irrelevant to the conclusion.

Each of the following, if true, helps to explain the trend
in journalism described above EXCEPT:
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Newspaper publishers have found that many
readers will cancel a subscription simply
because a view they take for granted has been
disputed by the publication.
The areas of knowledge on which journalists
report are growing in specialization and
diversity, while journalists themselves are not
becoming more broadly knowledgeable.
Persons supporting controversial views more
and more frequently choose to speak only to
reporters who seem sympathetic to their views.
A basic principle of journalism holds that debate
over controversial issues draws the attention of
the public.
Journalists who challenge the veracity of claims
are often criticized for failing their professional
obligation to be objective.

20.	 When people show signs of having a heart attack an
electrocardiograph (EKG) is often used to diagnose
their condition. In a study, a computer program for
EKG diagnosis of heart attacks was pitted against
a very experienced, highly skilled cardiologist. The
program correctly diagnosed a significantly higher
proportion of the cases that were later confirmed to be
heart attacks than did the cardiologist. Interpreting EKG
data, therefore, should be left to computer programs.
	

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

Experts agreed that the cardiologist made few
obvious mistakes in reading and interpreting the
EKG data.
The practice of medicine is as much an art as a
science, and computer programs are not easily
adapted to making subjective judgments.
The cardiologist correctly diagnosed a
significantly higher proportion of the cases in
which no heart attack occurred than did the
computer program.
In a considerable percentage of cases, EKG data
alone are insufficient to enable either computer
programs or cardiologists to make accurate
diagnoses.
The cardiologist in the study was
unrepresentative of cardiologists in general with
respect to skill and experience.

21.	 A government study indicates that raising speed limits
to reflect the actual average speeds of traffic on level,
straight stretches of high-speed roadways reduces the
accident rate. Since the actual average speed for level,
straight stretches of high-speed roadways tends to
be 120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per hour), that
should be set as a uniform national speed limit for level,
straight stretches of all such roadways.
	

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the reasoning above?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

Uniform national speed limits should apply only
to high-speed roadways.
Traffic laws applying to high-speed roadways
should apply uniformly across the nation.
A uniform national speed limit for highspeed roadways should be set only if all such
roadways have roughly equal average speeds of
traffic.
Long-standing laws that are widely violated are
probably not good laws.
Any measure that reduces the rate of traffic
accidents should be implemented.

22.	 Psychiatrist: In treating first-year students at this
university, I have noticed that those reporting the
highest levels of spending on recreation score
at about the same level on standard screening
instruments for anxiety and depression as
those reporting the lowest levels of spending
on recreation. This suggests that the first-year
students with high levels of spending on recreation
could reduce that spending without increasing
their anxiety or depression.
	

Each of the following, if true, strengthens the
psychiatrist’s argument EXCEPT:
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

At other universities, first-year students reporting
the highest levels of spending on recreation also
show the same degree of anxiety and depression
as do those reporting the lowest levels of such
spending.
Screening of first-year students at the university
who report moderate levels of spending on
recreation reveals that those students are less
anxious and depressed than both those with
the highest and those with the lowest levels of
spending on recreation.
Among adults between the ages of 40 and 60,
increased levels of spending on recreation are
strongly correlated with decreased levels of
anxiety and depression.
The screening instruments used by the
psychiatrist are extremely accurate in revealing
levels of anxiety and depression among
university students.
Several of the psychiatrist’s patients who are
first-year students at the university have reduced
their spending on recreation from very high
levels to very low levels without increasing their
anxiety or depression.

23.	 Every brick house on River Street has a front yard.
Most of the houses on River Street that have front yards

Which one of the following is most appropriate as
an analogy demonstrating that the reasoning in the
argument above is flawed?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

By that line of reasoning, we could conclude that
most politicians have run for office, since all
legislators are politicians and most legislators
have run for office.
By that line of reasoning, we could conclude
that most public servants are legislators, since
most legislators have run for office and most
politicians who have run for office are public
servants.
By that line of reasoning, we could conclude that
not every public servant has run for office, since
every legislator is a public servant but some
public servants are not legislators.
By that line of reasoning, we could conclude that
most legislators have never run for office, since
most public servants have never run for office
and all legislators are public servants.
By that line of reasoning, we could conclude that
most legislators are not public servants, since
most public servants have not run for office and
most legislators have run for office.

Historical events that fail to elicit moral
disapproval are generally not considered to
exemplify a moral theme.
The less inclined one is to morally judge human
behavior, the less likely it is that one holds clear
and unambiguous moral beliefs.
Only those who do not understand human history
attribute moral significance to historical events.
The more clear and unambiguous one’s moral
beliefs, the more likely one is to view history as
the working out of moral themes.
People tend to be less objective regarding a
subject about which they possess extensive

Because several of the candidates listed in the
poll had extensive experience as university
presidents, not all of the candidates could be
differentiated on this basis alone.
Most of the candidates listed in the poll had
extensive experience as university presidents.
Students taking the poll had fewer candidates
to choose from than were currently being
considered for the position.
Most of the students taking the poll did not
know whether any of the leading candidates
listed in the poll had ever served as a university
president.
Often a person can be well suited to a position
even though they have relatively little
experience in such a position.

24.	 Historian: It is unlikely that someone would see history
as the working out of moral themes unless he or
she held clear and unambiguous moral beliefs.
However, one’s inclination to morally judge
human behavior decreases as one’s knowledge of
history increases. Consequently, the more history
a person knows, the less likely that person is to
view history as the working out of moral themes.

25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.

If the statements above are true, it can be concluded on
the basis of them that
(A) 	 stimulation of the gene by chemicals in cigarette
smoke is not the only factor affecting the risk 	
for smokers of developing lung cancer
(B) 	 nonsmokers have as high a risk of developing
lung cancer as do smokers in whom the gene 	
has not been stimulated
(C) 	 smokers in whom the gene has been stimulated
are more likely to develop lung cancer than are
other smokers

chemicals in cigarette smoke than by other
chemicals
(E) 	 smokers are less likely to develop lung cancer if
they do not have the gene

5.	 In a poll of eligible voters conducted on the eve of a
mayoral election, more of those polled stated that they
favored Panitch than stated that they favored any other
candidate. Despite this result, another candidate, Yeung,
defeated Panitch by a comfortable margin.
	

Each of the following, if true, contributes to a resolution
of the discrepancy described above EXCEPT:
(A) 	 Of Yeung’s supporters, a smaller percentage
were 	eligible to vote than the percentage of
Panitch’s supporters who were eligible to vote.
(B) 	 A third candidate, Mulhem, conducted a press 	
conference on the morning of the election and 	
withdrew from the race.
(C) 	 The poll’s questions were designed by staff 	
members of Panitch’s campaign.
(D) 	 Of the poll respondents supporting Yeung, 70 	
percent described the election as “important” 	
or “very important,” while 30 percent of 		
respondents supporting Panitch did the same.
(E) 	 The poll, conducted on a Monday, surveyed
persons in the downtown area, and the
percentage of Yeung’s supporters who work
downtown is lower than that of Panitch’s 		
supporters.

6. 	 Commissioner: Budget forecasters project a revenue 	
shortfall of a billion dollars in the coming fiscal
year. Since there is no feasible way to increase 	
the available funds, our only choice is to decrease 	
expenditures. The plan before you outlines 		
feasible cuts that would yield savings of a billion 	
dollars over the coming fiscal year. We will be 	
able to solve the problem we face, therefore, only 	
if we adopt this plan.
	

The reasoning in the commissioner’s argument is
flawed because this argument
(A) 	 relies on information that is far from certain
(B) 	 confuses being an adequate solution with being a 	
required solution
(C) 	 inappropriately relies on the opinions of experts
(D) 	 inappropriately employs language that is vague
(E) 	 takes for granted that there is no way to increase 	
available funds

7. 	 Critic: Emily Dickinson’s poetry demonstrates that 	
meaning cannot reside entirely within a poem
itself, but is always the unique result of an 	
interaction between a reader’s system of beliefs 	
and the poem; and, of course, any two readers 	
from different cultures or eras have radically 	
different systems of beliefs.
	

If the critic’s statements are true, each of the following
could be true EXCEPT:
A) 	
(B) 	
(C) 	
(D) 	
(E) 	

A reader’s interpretation of a poem by Dickinson 	
is affected by someone else’s interpretation of 	
it.
A modern reader and a nineteenth‑century reader 	
interpret one of Shakespeare’s sonnets in the 	
same way.
A reader’s interpretation of a poem evolves over 	
time.
Two readers from the same era arrive at different 	
interpretations of the same poem.
A reader’s enjoyment of a poem is enhanced by 	
knowing the poet’s interpretation of it.

4. 	 A certain gene can be stimulated by chemicals in
cigarette smoke, causing lung cells to metabolize the
chemicals in a way that makes the cells cancerous. Yet
smokers in whom this gene is not stimulated have as
high a risk of developing lung cancer from smoking as
other smokers do.

8. 	 Archaeologist: The fact that the ancient Egyptians
and the Maya both built pyramids is often taken as
evidence of a historical link between Old‑ and 	
New‑World civilizations that is earlier than
any yet documented. But while these buildings
are similar to each other, there are important
differences in both design and function. The 	
Egyptian pyramids were exclusively tombs for 	
rulers, whereas the Mayan pyramids were used as
temples. This shows conclusively that there was 	
no such link between Old‑ and New‑World 	
civilizations.
	

Which one of the following most accurately describes a
flaw in the archaeologist’s argument?
(A) 	 The argument equivocates with respect to the 	
term 	“evidence.”
(B) 	 The argument appeals to emotion rather than to 	
reason.
(C) 	 The argument assumes the conclusion it is trying 	
to prove.
(D) 	 The argument incorrectly relies on words whose 	
meanings are vague or imprecise.
(E) 	 The argument presumes that no other evidence is 	
relevant to the issue at hand.

9. 	 Manuscripts written by first‑time authors generally do
not get serious attention by publishers except when
these authors happen to be celebrities. My manuscript
is unlikely to be taken seriously by publishers for I am a
first‑time author who is not a celebrity.
	

The structure of which one of the following arguments 	
is most similar to the structure of the argument above?
(A) 	 Challengers generally do not win elections
unless the incumbent has become very
unpopular. The incumbent in this election has
become very unpopular. Therefore, the 		
challenger may win.
(B) 	 Fruit salad that contains bananas is ordinarily a
boring dish unless it contains two or more 	
exotic fruits. This fruit salad has bananas in it, 	
and the only exotic fruit it has is guava. Thus, it 	
will probably be boring.
(C) 	 Thursday’s city council meeting is likely to be 	
poorly attended. Traditionally, council meetings
are sparsely attended if zoning issues are the
only ones on the agenda. The agenda for 		
Thursday is exclusively devoted to zoning.
(D) 	 The bulk of an estate generally goes to the 	
spouse, if surviving, and otherwise goes to 	
the surviving children. In this case there is no 	
surviving spouse; hence the bulk of the estate is 	
likely to go to the surviving children.
(E) 	 Normally about 40 percent of the deer population
will die over the winter unless it is extremely 	
mild. The percentage of the deer population that 	
died over the recent winter was the normal 40
percent. I conclude that the recent winter was 	
not unusually mild.

10.	 Twelve healthy volunteers with the Apo‑A‑IV‑1 gene
and twelve healthy volunteers who instead have the
Apo‑A‑IV‑2 gene each consumed a standard diet
supplemented daily by a high‑cholesterol food. A high
level of cholesterol in the blood is associated with an
increased risk of heart disease. After three weeks, the
blood cholesterol levels of the subjects in the second
group were unchanged, whereas the blood cholesterol
levels of those with the Apo‑A‑IV‑1 gene rose 20
percent.
	

Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A) 	 Approximately half the population carries a gene
that lowers cholesterol levels.
(B) 	 Most of those at risk of heart disease may be able
to reduce their risk by adopting a low­-		
cholesterol diet.
(C) 	 The bodies of those who have the Apo‑A‑IV‑2
gene excrete cholesterol when blood cholesterol
reaches a certain level.
(D) 	 The presence of the Apo‑A‑IV‑1 gene seems to
indicate that a person has a lower risk of heart
disease.
(E) 	 The presence of the Apo‑A‑IV‑2 gene may 	
inhibit the elevation of blood cholesterol.

Which one of the following, if true about the last year,
most seriously weakens the argument?
(A) 	 There was a recession that caused a high level of
unemployment in the city.
(B) 	 The morale of students who dropped out of high
school had been low even before they reached
high school.
(C) 	 As in the preceding year, more high school
students remained in school than dropped out.
(D) 	 High schools in the city established placement
offices to assist their graduates in obtaining
employment.
(E) 	 The antidropout program was primarily aimed
at improving students’ morale in those high
schools with the highest dropout rates.

12.	 The television show Henry was not widely watched
until it was scheduled for Tuesday evenings
immediately after That’s Life, the most popular show
on television. During the year after the move, Henry
was consistently one of the ten most‑watched shows on
television. Since Henry’s recent move to Wednesday
evenings, however, it has been watched by far fewer
people. We must conclude that Henry was widely
watched before the move to Wednesday evenings
because it followed That’s Life and not because people
especially liked it.
	

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A) 	Henry has been on the air for three years, but
That’s Life has been on the air for only two
years.
(B) 	 The show that replaced Henry on Tuesdays has
persistently had a low number of viewers in the
Tuesday time slot.
(C) 	 The show that now follows That’s Life on
Tuesdays has double the number of viewers it
had before being moved.
(D) 	 After its recent move to Wednesday, Henry
was aired at the same time as the second most
popular show on television.
(E)	 That’s Life was not widely watched during the
first year it was aired.

Questions 13‑14
Joseph: My encyclopedia says that the mathematician
Pierre de Fermat died in 1665 without leaving behind
any written proof for a theorem that he claimed
nonetheless to have proved. Probably this alleged
theorem simply cannot be proved, since—as the article
points out—no one else has been able to prove it.
Therefore it is likely that Fermat was either lying or
else mistaken when he made his claim.
Laura: Your encyclopedia is out of date. Recently someone
has in fact proved Fermat’s theorem. And since the
theorem is provable, your claim—that Fermat was
lying or mistaken—clearly is wrong.
13.	 Joseph’s statement that “this alleged theorem simply
cannot be proved” plays which one of the following
roles in his argument?
(A) 	 an assumption for which no support is offered
(B) 	 a subsidiary conclusion on which his argument’s
main conclusion is based
(C) 	 a potential objection that his argument
anticipates and attempts to answer before it is 	
raised
(D) 	 the principal claim that his argument is structured
to refute
(E) 	 background information that neither supports nor
undermines his argument’s conclusion
14.	 Which one of the following most accurately describes a
reasoning error in Laura’s argument?
(A) 	 It purports to establish its conclusion by making 	
a claim that, if true, would actually contradict 	
that conclusion.
(B) 	 It mistakenly assumes that the quality of a 	
person’s character can legitimately be taken to 	
guarantee the accuracy of the claims that person 	
has made. 	
(C) 	 It mistakes something that is necessary for its 	
conclusion to follow for something that ensures 	
that the conclusion follows.
(D) 	 It uses the term “provable” without defining it.
(E) 	 It fails to distinguish between a true claim that 	
has mistakenly been believed to be false and a 	
false claim that has mistakenly been believed to 	
be true.

11.	 High school students who feel that they are not
succeeding in school often drop out before graduating
and go to work. Last year, however, the city’s high
school dropout rate was significantly lower than the
previous year’s rate. This is encouraging evidence that
the program instituted two years ago to improve the
morale of high school students has begun to take effect
to reduce dropouts.

15.	 It is not good for a university to have class sizes that
are very large or very small, or to have professors with
teaching loads that are very light or very heavy. After
all, crowded classes and overworked faculty cripple the
institution’s ability to recruit and retain both qualified
students and faculty.

17.	 Researchers have found that people who drink five or
more cups of coffee a day have a risk of heart disease
2.5 times the average after corrections are made for age
and smoking habits. Members of the research team say
that, on the basis of their findings, they now limit their
own daily coffee intake to two cups.

	

	

Which one of the following, if added as a premise to the
argument, most helps to justify its conclusion?	
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Professors who have very high teaching loads 	
tend to focus their remaining time on research.
Classes that have very low numbers of students	
tend to have a lot of classroom discussion.
Very small class sizes or very light teaching 	
loads indicate incompetence in classroom
instruction.
Very small class sizes or very light teaching 	
loads	are common in the worst and the best 	
universities.	
Professors with very light teaching loads have no 	
more office hours for students than professors
with normal teaching loads.	

16.	 Sales manager: The highest priority should be given 	
to the needs of the sales department, because 	
without successful sales the company as a whole 	
would fail.
	

Shipping manager: There are several departments 	
other than sales that also must function 		
successfully for the company to succeed. It is 	
impossible to give the highest priority to all of 	
them.
			
	
The shipping manager criticizes the sales manager’s
argument by pointing out
(A) 	 that the sales department taken by itself is not 	
critical to the company’s success as a whole
(B) 	 the ambiguity of the term “highest priority”
(C)	 that departments other than sales are more vital 	
to the company’s success
(D) 	 an absurd consequence of its apparent 		
assumption that a department’s necessity earns 	
it the highest priority
(E) 	 that the sales manager makes a generalization
from an atypical case

Which one of the following, if true, indicates that the
researchers’ precaution might NOT have the result of
decreasing their risk of heart disease?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

The study found that for people who drank three 	
or more cups of coffee daily, the additional risk 	
of heart disease increased with each extra daily 	
cup.
Per capita coffee consumption has been declining
over the past 20 years because of the increasing
popularity of soft drinks and also because of
health worries.
The study did not collect information that would
show whether variations in level of coffee
consumption are directly related to variations in
level of stress, a major causal factor in heart 	
disease.
Subsequent studies have consistently shown that 	
heavy smokers consume coffee at about 3 times 	
the rate of nonsmokers.
Subsequent studies have shown that heavy coffee 	
consumption tends to cause an elevated blood-	
cholesterol level, an immediate indicator of 	
increased risk of heart disease.

Which one of the following statements, if true, most
strengthens the argument?
(A) 	 Those who offer new ways of justifying current 	
political power often reap the benefits of their 	
own innovations.
(B) 	 Politically powerful people tend to reward those 	
who they believe are useful to them and to 	
punish those who they believe are a threat.
(C) 	 Ethical inventiveness and technical ingenuity are 	
never possessed by the same individuals.
(D) 	 New technologies are often used by people who 	
strive to defeat those who currently have 		
political power.
(E) 	 Many people who possess ethical inventiveness 	
conceal their novel ethical arguments for fear of 	
retribution by the politically powerful.

19.	 Birds need so much food energy to maintain their body
temperatures that some of them spend most of their
time eating. But a comparison of a bird of a seed‑eating
species to a bird of a nectar‑eating species that has the
same overall energy requirement would surely show
that the seed‑eating bird spends more time eating than
does the nectar‑eating bird, since a given amount of
nectar provides more energy than does the same amount
of seeds.
	

The argument relies on which one of the following
questionable assumptions?
(A) 	 Birds of different species do not generally have
the same overall energy requirements as each
other.
(B) 	 The nectar‑eating bird does not sometimes also
eat seeds.
(C) 	 The time it takes for the nectar‑eating bird to eat
a given amount of nectar is not longer than the
time it takes the seed‑eating bird to eat the same
amount of seeds.
(D) 	 The seed‑eating bird does not have a lower body
temperature than that of the nectar‑eating bird.
(E) 	 The overall energy requirements of a given bird
do not depend on factors such as the size of the
bird, its nest‑building habits, and the climate of
the region in which it lives.

20.	 Consumer advocate: The introduction of a new
drug into the marketplace should be contingent
upon our having a good understanding of its
social impact. However, the social impact of
the newly marketed antihistamine is far from
clear. It is obvious, then, that there should be a
general reduction in the pace of bringing to the
marketplace new drugs that are now being tested.
	

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A) 	 The social impact of the new antihistamine is 	
much better understood than that of most new 	
drugs being tested.
(B) 	 The social impact of some of the new drugs 	
being tested is poorly understood.
(C) 	 The economic success of some drugs is inversely 	
proportional to how well we understand their 	
social impact.
(D) 	 The new antihistamine is chemically similar to 	
some of the new drugs being tested.
(E) 	 The new antihistamine should be on the market 	
only if most new drugs being tested should be 	
on the market also.

18.	 People who have political power tend to see new
technologies as a means of extending or protecting
their power, whereas they generally see new ethical
arguments and ideas as a threat to it. Therefore,
technical ingenuity usually brings benefits to those
who have this ingenuity, whereas ethical inventiveness
brings only pain to those who have this inventiveness.

21.	 Tina:

For centuries oceans and human eccentricity 	
have been linked in the literary and artistic 		
imagination. Such linkage is probably due to 	
the European Renaissance practice of using ships 	
as asylums for the socially undesirable.

	

Sergio: No. Oceans have always been viewed as 	
mysterious and unpredictable—qualities that
people have invariably associated with 		
eccentricity.

	

Tina’s and Sergio’s statements lend the most support
to the claim that they disagree about which one of the
following statements?
(A) 	 Eccentric humans were considered socially 	
undesirable during the European Renaissance.
(B) 	 Oceans have always been viewed as mysterious 	
and unpredictable.
(C) 	 The linkage between oceans and eccentricity 	
explains the European Renaissance custom of 	
using ships as asylums.
(D) 	 People have never attributed the same qualities to 	
oceans and eccentrics.
(E) 	 The linkage between oceans and eccentricity 	
predates the European Renaissance.

22.	 In a recent study, a group of subjects had their
normal daily caloric intake increased by 25 percent.
This increase was entirely in the form of alcohol.
Another group of similar subjects had alcohol replace
nonalcoholic sources of 25 percent of their normal daily
caloric intake. All subjects gained body fat over the
course of the study, and the amount of body fat gained
was the same for both groups.
	

Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A) 	 Alcohol is metabolized more quickly by the body
than are other foods or drinks.
(B) 	 In the general population, alcohol is the primary 	
cause of gains in body fat.
(C) 	 An increased amount of body fat does not 		
necessarily imply a weight gain.
(D) 	 Body fat gain is not dependent solely on the 	
number of calories one consumes.
(E) 	 The proportion of calories from alcohol in a diet 	
is more significant for body fat gain than are the 	
total calories from alcohol.

23.	 When investigators discovered that the director of a
local charity had repeatedly overstated the number of
people his charity had helped, the director accepted
responsibility for the deception. However, the
investigators claimed that journalists were as much
to blame as the director was for inflating the charity’s
reputation, since they had naïvely accepted what the
director told them, and simply reported as fact the
numbers he gave them.
	

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the investigators’ claim?
(A) 	 Anyone who works for a charitable organization 	
is obliged to be completely honest about the 	
activities of that organization.
(B) 	 Anyone who knowingly aids a liar by trying to 	
conceal the truth from others is also a liar.
(C) 	 Anyone who presents as factual a story that 	
turns out to be untrue without first attempting 	
to verify that story is no less responsible for the 	
consequences of that story than anyone else is.
(D) 	 Anyone who lies in order to advance his or her 	
own career is more deserving of blame than 	
someone who lies in order to promote a good 	
cause.
(E) 	 Anyone who accepts responsibility for a 		
wrongful act that he or she committed is less 	
deserving of blame than someone who tries to 	
conceal his or her own wrongdoing.

Which one of the following, if true, most calls into
question the argument made by the companies
promoting voice mail?
(A) 	 Unlike calls made to owners of answering 	
machines, all telephone calls made to 		
voice‑mail subscribers are completed, even if 	
the line called is in use at the time of the call.
(B) 	 The surge in sales of answering machines 		
occurred shortly after they were first introduced 	
to the electronics market.
(C) 	 Once a telephone customer decides to subscribe 	
to voice mail, that customer can cancel the 	
service at any time.
(D) 	 Answering machines enable the customer to 	
hear who is calling before the customer decides 	
whether to answer the telephone, a service voice 	
mail does not provide.
(E) 	 The number of messages a telephone answering 	
machine can record is limited by the length of 	
the magnetic tape on which calls are recorded.

25.	 The judgment that an artist is great always rests on
assessments of the work the artist has produced. A
series of great works is the only indicator of greatness.
Therefore, to say that an artist is great is just to
summarize the quality of his or her known works, and
the artist’s greatness can provide no basis for predicting
the quality of the artist’s unknown or future works.
	

Which one of the following contains questionable
reasoning most similar to that in the argument above?
(A) 	 The only way of knowing whether someone has 	
a cold is to observe symptoms. Thus, when a
person is said to have a cold, this means only
that he or she has displayed the symptoms of a
cold, and no prediction about the patient’s 	
future symptoms is justified.
(B) 	 Although colds are very common, there are some
people who never or only very rarely catch
colds. Clearly these people must be in some
way physiologically different from people who
catch colds frequently.
(C) 	 Someone who has a cold is infected by a cold
virus. No one can be infected by the same cold
virus twice, but there are indefinitely many
different cold viruses. Therefore, it is not
possible to predict from a person’s history of
infection how susceptible he or she will be in
the future.
(D) 	 The viruses that cause colds are not all the
same, and they differ in their effects. Therefore,
although it may be certain that a person has a
cold, it is impossible to predict how the cold
will progress.
(E) 	 Unless a person displays cold symptoms, it
cannot properly be said that the person has a
cold. But each of the symptoms of a cold is also
the symptom of some other disease. Therefore,
one can never be certain that a person has a 	
cold.

24.	 Telephone companies are promoting “voice mail” as
an alternative to the answering machine. By recording
messages from callers when a subscriber does not have
access to his or her telephone, voice mail provides a
service similar to that of an answering machine. The
companies promoting this service argue that it will soon
make answering machines obsolete, since it is much
more convenient, more flexible, and less expensive than
an answering machine.

26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the
response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense
standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the
corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1.	 Among Trinidadian guppies, males with large spots
are more attractive to females than are males with
small spots, who consequently are presented with less
frequent mating opportunities. Yet guppies with small
spots are more likely to avoid detection by predators,
so in waters where predators are abundant only guppies
with small spots live to maturity.
	

The situation described above most closely conforms to
which one of the following generalizations?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

A trait that helps attract mates is sometimes more
dangerous to one sex than to another.
Those organisms that are most attractive to
the opposite sex have the greatest number of
offspring.
Those organisms that survive the longest have
the greatest number of offspring.
Whether a trait is harmful to the organisms of a
species can depend on which sex possesses it.
A trait that is helpful to procreation can also
hinder it in certain environments.

2.	 Programmer: We computer programmers at Mytheco
are demanding raises to make our average salary
comparable with that of the technical writers here
who receive, on average, 20 percent more in salary
and benefits than we do. This pay difference is
unfair and intolerable.
	

	

Mytheco executive: But many of the technical writers
have worked for Mytheco longer than have many
of the programmers. Since salary and benefits
at Mytheco are directly tied to seniority, the 20
percent pay difference you mention is perfectly
acceptable.
Evaluating the adequacy of the Mytheco executive’s
response requires a clarification of which one of the
following?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

whether any of the technical writers at Mytheco
once worked as programmers at the company
how the average seniority of programmers
compares with the average seniority of technical
writers
whether the sorts of benefits an employee of
Mytheco receives are tied to the salary of that
employee
whether the Mytheco executive was at one time a
technical writer employed by Mytheco
how the Mytheco executive’s salary compares
with that of the programmers

3.	 Cable TV stations have advantages that enable them to
attract many more advertisers than broadcast networks
attract. For example, cable stations are able to target
particular audiences with 24-hour news, sports, or
movies, whereas broadcast networks must offer a
variety of programming. Cable can also offer lower
advertising rates than any broadcast network can,
because it is subsidized by viewers through subscriber
fees. Additionally, many cable stations have expanded
worldwide with multinational programming.
	

The statements above, if true, provide support for each
of the following EXCEPT:
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Some broadcast networks can be viewed in
several countries.
Broadcast networks do not rely on subscriber
fees from viewers.
Low costs are often an important factor for
advertisers in selecting a station or network on
which to run a TV ad.
Some advertisers prefer to have the opportunity
to address a worldwide audience.
The audiences that some advertisers prefer to
target watch 24-hour news stations.

4.	 In polluted industrial English cities during the Industrial
Revolution, two plant diseases—black spot, which
infects roses, and tar spot, which infects sycamore
trees—disappeared. It is likely that air pollution
eradicated these diseases.
	

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the reasoning above?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

Scientists theorize that some plants can develop a
resistance to air pollution.
Certain measures help prevent infection by black
spot and tar spot, but once infection occurs, it is
very difficult to eliminate.
For many plant species, scientists have not
determined the effects of air pollution.
Black spot and tar spot returned when the air in
the cities became less polluted.
Black spot and tar spot were the only plant
diseases that disappeared in any English cities
during the Industrial Revolution.

Which one of the following statements is most
supported by the information above?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

The abridgment was prepared by Shakespeare.
The abridgment was created to make Hamlet
easier to produce on stage.
The abridgment was produced by an actor who
had played a role in Hamlet.
The abridgement was prepared by a spectator of
a performance of Hamlet.
The abridgment was produced by an actor who
was trying to improve the play.

6.	 Musicologist: Many critics complain of the
disproportion between text and music in Handel’s
da capo arias. These texts are generally quite short
and often repeated well beyond what is needed for
literal understanding. Yet such criticism is refuted
by noting that repetition serves a vital function:
it frees the audience to focus on the music itself,
which can speak to audiences whatever their
language.

7.	 Baxe Interiors, one of the largest interior design
companies in existence, currently has a near monopoly
in the corporate market. Several small design
companies have won prestigious awards for their
corporate work, while Baxe has won none. Nonetheless,
the corporate managers who solicit design proposals
will only contract with companies they believe are
unlikely to go bankrupt, and they believe that only very
large companies are unlikely to go bankrupt.
	

The statements above, if true, most strongly support
which one of the following?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	

(E)	

There are other very large design companies
besides Baxe, but they produce designs that are
inferior to Baxe’s.
Baxe does not have a near monopoly in the
market of any category of interior design other
than corporate interiors.
For the most part, designs that are produced by
small companies are superior to the designs
produced by Baxe.
At least some of the corporate managers who
solicit design proposals are unaware that there
are designs that are much better than those
produced by Baxe.
The existence of interior designs that are superior
to those produced by Baxe does not currently
threaten its near monopoly in the corporate
market.

Which one of the following sentences best expresses the
main point of the musicologist’s reasoning?
(A)	Handel’s da capo arias contain a disproportionate
amount of music.
(B)	Handel’s da capo arias are superior to most in
their accessibility to diverse audiences.
(C)	 At least one frequent criticism of Handel’s da
capo arias is undeserved.
(D)	 At least some of Handel’s da capo arias contain
unnecessary repetitions.
(E)	 Most criticism of Handel’s da capo arias is
unwarranted.

5.	 Many scholars are puzzled about who created the
seventeenth-century abridgment of Shakespeare’s
Hamlet contained in the First Quarto. Two facts about
the work shed light on this question. First, the person
who undertook the abridgment clearly did not possess
a copy of Hamlet. Second, the abridgment contains a
very accurate rendering of the speeches of one of the
characters, but a slipshod handling of all the other parts.

8.	 The giant Chicxulub crater in Mexico provides
indisputable evidence that a huge asteroid, about six
miles across, struck Earth around the time many of
the last dinosaur species were becoming extinct. But
this catastrophe was probably not responsible for most
of these extinctions. Any major asteroid strike kills
many organisms in or near the region of the impact, but
there is little evidence that such a strike could have a
worldwide effect. Indeed, some craters even larger than
the Chicxulub crater were made during times in Earth’s
history when there were no known extinctions.
	

Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken
the argument?
(A)	

(B)	
(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

The vast majority of dinosaur species are known
to have gone extinct well before the time of the
asteroid impact that produced the Chicxulub
crater.
The size of a crater caused by an asteroid striking
Earth generally depends on both the size of that
asteroid and the force of its impact.
Fossils have been discovered of a number of
dinosaurs that clearly died as a result of the
asteroid impact that produced the Chicxulub
crater.
There is no evidence that any other asteroid of
equal size struck Earth at the same time as the
asteroid that produced the Chicxulub crater.
During the period immediately before the
asteroid that produced the Chicxulub crater
struck, most of the world’s dinosaurs lived in
or near the region of the asteroid’s impending
impact.

1,000 peanuts from lot B, 50 of the peanuts from lot
A were found to be infected with Aspergillus. Two
hundred of the peanuts from lot B were found to be
infected with Aspergillus. Therefore, infection with
Aspergillus is more widespread in lot B than in lot A.
	

The reasoning in which one of the following is most
similar to the reasoning in the argument above?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

Every one of these varied machine parts is of
uniformly high quality. Therefore, the machine
that we assemble from them will be of equally
high quality.
If a plant is carelessly treated, it is likely to
develop blight. If a plant develops blight, it is
likely to die. Therefore, if a plant is carelessly
treated, it is likely to die.
In the past 1,000 experiments, whenever an
experimental fungicide was applied to coffee
plants infected with coffee rust, the infection
disappeared. The coffee rust never disappeared
before the fungicide was applied. Therefore, in
these experiments, application of the fungicide
caused the disappearance of coffee rust.
Three thousand registered voters—1,500
members of the Liberal party and 1,500
members of the Conservative party—were
asked which mayoral candidate they favored.
Four hundred of the Liberals and 300 of the
Conservatives favored Pollack. Therefore,
Pollack has more support among Liberals than
among Conservatives.
All of my livestock are registered with the
regional authority. None of the livestock
registered with the regional authority are freerange livestock. Therefore, none of my livestock

The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the
argument
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

treats a sufficient condition for the airport’s being
built as a necessary condition
concludes that something must be true, because
most people believe it to be true
concludes, on the basis that a certain event is
unlikely to occur, that the event will not occur
fails to consider whether people living near
Dalton would favor building the airport
overlooks the possibility that a new airport could
benefit the local economy

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the decrease in travel times described above?
(A)	

(B)	

Increased knowledge of the causes of job loss
could lead to economic disaster.
An individual’s belief in his or her own
abilities is the only reliable protection against
impersonal social forces.
Governments should never interfere with
economic forces.
Societal demand for government control of the
economy is growing.
In general, people should feel no more
responsible for economic disasters than for
military invasions.

11.	 A development company has proposed building an
airport near the city of Dalton. If the majority of
Dalton’s residents favor the proposal, the airport will be
built. However, it is unlikely that a majority of Dalton’s
residents would favor the proposal, for most of them
believe that the airport would create noise problems.
Thus, it is unlikely that the airport will be built.

12.	 After the rush-hour speed limit on the British M25
motorway was lowered from 70 miles per hour
(115 kilometers per hour) to 50 miles per hour (80
kilometers per hour), rush-hour travel times decreased
by approximately 15 percent.

The economist’s statements, if true, most strongly
support which one of the following?
(A)	

	

5

(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

After the decrease in the rush-hour speed limit,
the average speed on the M25 was significantly
lower during rush hours than at other times of
the day.
Travel times during periods other than rush hours
were essentially unchanged after the rush-hour
speed limit was lowered.
Before the rush-hour speed limit was lowered,
rush-hour accidents that caused lengthy delays
were common, and most of these accidents were
caused by high-speed driving.
Enforcement of speed limits on the M25 was
quite rigorous both before and after the rushhour speed limit was lowered.
The number of people who drive on the M25
during rush hours did not increase after the
rush-hour speed limit was lowered.

13.	 An art critic, by ridiculing an artwork, can undermine
the pleasure one takes in it; conversely, by lavishing
praise upon an artwork, an art critic can render the
experience of viewing the artwork more pleasurable. So
an artwork’s artistic merit can depend not only on the
person who creates it but also on those who critically
evaluate it.
	

The conclusion can be properly drawn if which one of
the following is assumed?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

The merit of an artistic work is determined by
the amount of pleasure it elicits.
Most people lack the confidence necessary for
making their own evaluations of art.
Art critics understand what gives an artwork
artistic merit better than artists do.
Most people seek out critical reviews of
particular artworks before viewing those works.
The pleasure people take in something is
typically influenced by what they think others
feel about it.

10.	 Economist: If the belief were to become widespread
that losing one’s job is not a sign of personal
shortcomings but instead an effect of impersonal
social forces (which is surely correct), there
would be growth in the societal demand for
more government control of the economy to
protect individuals from these forces, just as the
government now protects them from military
invasion. Such extensive government control of
the economy would lead to an economic disaster,
however.

14.	 The number of automobile thefts has declined steadily
during the past five years, and it is more likely now than
it was five years ago that someone who steals a car will
be convicted of the crime.
	

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the facts cited above?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	
(D)	

(E)	

Although there are fewer car thieves now than
there were five years ago, the proportion of
thieves who tend to abandon cars before their
owners notice that they have been stolen has
also decreased.
Car alarms are more common than they were five
years ago, but their propensity to be triggered in
the absence of any criminal activity has resulted
in people generally ignoring them when they are
triggered.
An upsurge in home burglaries over the last five
years has required police departments to divert
limited resources to investigation of these cases.
Because of the increasingly lucrative market for
stolen automobile parts, many stolen cars are
quickly disassembled and the parts are sold to
various buyers across the country.
There are more adolescent car thieves now than
there were five years ago, and the sentences
given to young criminals tend to be far more
lenient than those given to adult criminals.

15.	 Legislator: My staff conducted a poll in which my
constituents were asked whether they favor high
taxes. More than 97 percent answered “no.”
Clearly, then, my constituents would support
the bill I recently introduced, which reduces the
corporate income tax.
	

The reasoning in the legislator’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

fails to establish that the opinions of the
legislator’s constituents are representative of the
opinions of the country’s population as a whole
fails to consider whether the legislator’s
constituents consider the current corporate
income tax a high tax
confuses an absence of evidence that the
legislator’s constituents oppose a bill with
the existence of evidence that the legislator’s
constituents support that bill
draws a conclusion that merely restates a claim
presented in support of that conclusion
treats a result that proves that the public supports
a bill as a result that is merely consistent with
public support for that bill

16.	 Many nursing homes have prohibitions against having
pets, and these should be lifted. The presence of an
animal companion can yield health benefits by reducing
a person’s stress. A pet can also make one’s time at
a home more rewarding, which will be important to
more people as the average life span of our population
increases.
	

Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn in the argument above?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

As the average life span increases, it will be
important to more people that life in nursing
homes be rewarding.
Residents of nursing homes should enjoy the
same rewarding aspects of life as anyone else.
The policy that many nursing homes have should
be changed so that residents are allowed to have
pets.
Having a pet can reduce one’s stress and thereby
make one a healthier person.
The benefits older people derive from having

17.	 Near many cities, contamination of lakes and rivers
from pollutants in rainwater runoff exceeds that
from industrial discharge. As the runoff washes over
buildings and pavements, it picks up oil and other
pollutants. Thus, water itself is among the biggest water
polluters.
	

The statement that contamination of lakes and rivers
from pollutants in rainwater runoff exceeds that from
industrial discharge plays which one of the following
roles in the argument?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

It is a conclusion for which the claim that water
itself should be considered a polluter is offered
as support.
It is cited as evidence that pollution from
rainwater runoff is a more serious problem than
pollution from industrial discharge.
It is a generalization based on the observation
that rainwater runoff picks up oil and other
pollutants as it washes over buildings and
pavements.
It is a premise offered in support of the
conclusion that water itself is among the biggest
water polluters.
It is stated to provide an example of a typical
kind of city pollution.

Tate: The freedom and autonomy that democracy
provides are of genuine value, but the simple
material needs of people are more important.
Some countries can better meet these needs as
autocracies than as democracies.
Wong’s and Tate’s statements provide the most support
for the claim that they disagree over the truth of which
one of the following?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

There are some countries that are better off as
autocracies than as democracies.
Nothing is more important to a country than the
freedom and autonomy of the individuals who
live in that country.
In some cases, a country cannot become a
democracy.
The freedom and autonomy that democracy
provides are of genuine value.
All democracies succeed in meeting the simple
material needs of people.

19.	 Principle: When none of the fully qualified candidates
for a new position at Arvue Corporation currently
works for that company, it should hire the
candidate who would be most productive in that
position.
	

Application: Arvue should not hire Krall for the new
position, because Delacruz is a candidate and is
fully qualified.

	

Which one of the following, if true, justifies the above
application of the principle?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

All of the candidates are fully qualified for the
new position, but none already works for Arvue.
Of all the candidates who do not already
work for Arvue, Delacruz would be the most
productive in the new position.
Krall works for Arvue, but Delacruz is the
candidate who would be most productive in the
new position.
Several candidates currently work for Arvue, but
Krall and Delacruz do not.
None of the candidates already works for Arvue,
and Delacruz is the candidate who would be
most productive in the new position.

20.	 Many important types of medicine have been developed
from substances discovered in plants that grow only
in tropical rain forests. There are thousands of plant
species in these rain forests that have not yet been
studied by scientists, and it is very likely that many
such plants also contain substances of medicinal value.
Thus, if the tropical rain forests are not preserved,
important types of medicine will never be developed.
	

Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)	

(B)	
(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

There are substances of medicinal value
contained in tropical rain forest plants not yet
studied by scientists that differ from those
substances already discovered in tropical rain
forest plants.
Most of the tropical rain forest plants that contain
substances of medicinal value can also be found
growing in other types of environment.
The majority of plant species that are unique to
tropical rain forests and that have been studied
by scientists have been discovered to contain
substances of medicinal value.
Any substance of medicinal value contained in
plant species indigenous to tropical rain forests
will eventually be discovered if those species
are studied by scientists.
The tropical rain forests should be preserved to
make it possible for important medicines to be
developed from plant species that have not yet
been studied by scientists.

21.	 In modern deep-diving marine mammals, such as
whales, the outer shell of the bones is porous. This has
the effect of making the bones light enough so that it is
easy for the animals to swim back to the surface after a
deep dive. The outer shell of the bones was also porous
in the ichthyosaur, an extinct prehistoric marine reptile.
We can conclude from this that ichthyosaurs were deep
divers.

23.	 Columnist: Although much has been learned,
we are still largely ignorant of the intricate
interrelationships among species of living
organisms. We should, therefore, try to preserve
the maximum number of species if we have an
interest in preserving any, since allowing species
toward which we are indifferent to perish might
undermine the viability of other species.

	

	

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	

(E)	

Some deep-diving marine species must surface
after dives but do not have bones with porous
outer shells.
In most modern marine reptile species, the outer
shell of the bones is not porous.
In most modern and prehistoric marine reptile
species that are not deep divers, the outer shell
of the bones is porous.
In addition to the porous outer shells of their
bones, whales have at least some characteristics
suited to deep diving for which there is no
clear evidence whether these were shared by
ichthyosaurs.
There is evidence that the bones of ichthyosaurs
would have been light enough to allow surfacing
even if the outer shells were not porous.

22.	 Librarian: Some argue that the preservation grant we
received should be used to restore our original
copy of our town’s charter, since if the charter
is not restored, it will soon deteriorate beyond
repair. But this document, although sentimentally
important, has no scholarly value. Copies are
readily available. Since we are a research library
and not a museum, the money would be better
spent preserving documents that have significant
scholarly value.
	

The claim that the town’s charter, if not restored, will
soon deteriorate beyond repair plays which one of the
following roles in the librarian’s argument?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

It is a claim that the librarian’s argument
attempts to show to be false.
It is the conclusion of the argument that the
librarian’s argument rejects.
It is a premise in an argument whose conclusion
is rejected by the librarian’s argument.
It is a premise used to support the librarian’s
main conclusion.
It is a claim whose truth is required by the
librarian’s argument.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the columnist’s argument?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

It is strongly in our interest to preserve certain
plant and animal species.
We should not take any action until all relevant
scientific facts have been established and taken
into account.
We should not allow the number of species
to diminish any further than is necessary for
the flourishing of present and future human
populations.
We should not allow a change to occur unless we
are assured that that change will not jeopardize
anything that is important to us.
We should always undertake the course of action
that is likely to have the best consequences in
the immediate future.

24.	 One is likely to feel comfortable approaching a stranger
if the stranger is of one’s approximate age. Therefore,
long-term friends are probably of the same approximate
age as each other since most long-term friendships
begin because someone felt comfortable approaching a
stranger.
	

The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that it
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	

(D)	
(E)	

presumes, without warrant, that one is likely to
feel uncomfortable approaching a person only if
that person is a stranger
infers that a characteristic is present in a situation
from the fact that that characteristic is present in
most similar situations
overlooks the possibility that one is less likely
to feel comfortable approaching someone who
is one’s approximate age if that person is a
stranger than if that person is not a stranger
presumes, without warrant, that one never
approaches a stranger unless one feels
comfortable doing so
fails to address whether one is likely to feel
comfortable approaching a stranger who is not
one’s approximate age

The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)	
(B)	
(C)	
(D)	
(E)	

There can be no rule of law without social
integrity.
There can be no social integrity without the rule
of law.
One cannot pursue the good life without the rule

freedom prevails.
There can be no rule of law without individual

26.	 Economist: Countries with an uneducated population
are destined to be weak economically and
politically, whereas those with an educated
population have governments that display a
serious financial commitment to public education.
So any nation with a government that has made
such a commitment will avoid economic and
political weakness.
	

The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the
following arguments is most similar to that in the
economist’s argument?
(A)	

(B)	

(C)	

(D)	

(E)	

Animal species with a very narrow diet will have
more difficulty surviving if the climate suddenly
changes, but a species with a broader diet will
not; for changes in the climate can remove the
traditional food supply.
People incapable of empathy are not good
candidates for public office, but those who
do have the capacity for empathy are able to
manipulate others easily; hence, people who
can manipulate others are good candidates for
public office.
People who cannot give orders are those who do
not understand the personalities of the people
to whom they give orders. Thus, those who
can give orders are those who understand the
personalities of the people to whom they give
orders.
Poets who create poetry of high quality are those
who have studied traditional poetry, because
poets who have not studied traditional poetry
are the poets most likely to create something
shockingly inventive, and poetry that is
shockingly inventive is rarely fine poetry.
People who dislike exercise are unlikely to lose
weight without sharply curtailing their food
intake; but since those who dislike activity
generally tend to avoid it, people who like to
eat but dislike exercise will probably fail to lose
weight.
