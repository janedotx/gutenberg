The Canadian Auto Workers’ (CAW) Legal
Services Plan, designed to give active and retired
autoworkers and their families access to totally
prepaid or partially reimbursed legal services, has
been in operation since late 1985. Plan members have
the option of using either the plan’s staff lawyers,
whose services are fully covered by the cost of
membership in the plan, or an outside lawyer. Outside
lawyers, in turn, can either sign up with the plan as a
“cooperating lawyer” and accept the CAW’s fee
schedule as payment in full, or they can charge a
higher fee and collect the balance from the client.
Autoworkers appear to have embraced the notion of
prepaid legal services: 45 percent of eligible union
members were enrolled in the plan by 1988.
Moreover, the idea of prepaid legal services has been
spreading in Canada. A department store is even
offering a plan to holders of its credit card.
While many plan members seem to be happy to
get reduced-cost legal help, many lawyers are
concerned about the plan’s effect on their profession,
especially its impact on prices for legal services.
Some point out that even though most lawyers have
not joined the plan as cooperating lawyers, legal fees
in the cities in which the CAW plan operates have
been depressed, in some cases to an unproﬁtable
level. The directors of the plan, however, claim that
both clients and lawyers beneﬁt from their
arrangement. For while the clients get ready access to
reduced-price services, lawyers get professional
contact with people who would not otherwise be
using legal services, which helps generate even more
business for their ﬁrms. Experience shows, the
directors say, that if people are referred to a ﬁrm and
receive excellent service, the ﬁrm will get three to
four other referrals who are not plan subscribers and
who would therefore pay the ﬁrm’s standard rate.
But it is unlikely that increased use of such plans
will result in long-term client satisfaction or in a
substantial increase in proﬁts for law ﬁrms. Since
lawyers with established reputations and client bases
can beneﬁt little, if at all, from participation, the
plans function largely as marketing devices for
lawyers who have yet to establish themselves. While
many of these lawyers are no doubt very able and
conscientious, they will tend to have less expertise
and to provide less satisfaction to clients. At the same
time, the downward pressure on fees will mean that
the full-fee referrals that proponents say will come
through plan participation may not make up for a

(55)

1.

ﬁrm’s investment in providing services at low plan
rates. And since lowered fees provide little incentive
for lawyers to devote more than minimal effort to
cases, a “volume discount” approach toward the
practice of law will mean less time devoted to
complex cases and a general lowering of quality for
clients.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

2.

In the short term, prepaid legal plans such as
the CAW Legal Services Plan appear to be
beneﬁcial to both lawyers and clients, but in the
long run lawyers will proﬁt at the expense of
clients.
The CAW Legal Services Plan and other similar
plans represent a controversial, but probably
effective, way of bringing down the cost of
legal services to clients and increasing lawyers’
clientele.
The use of prepaid legal plans such as that of
the CAW should be rejected in favor of a more
equitable means of making legal services more
generally affordable.
In spite of widespread consumer support for
legal plans such as that offered by the CAW,
lawyers generally criticize such plans, mainly
because of their potential ﬁnancial impact on
the legal profession.
Although they have so far attracted many
subscribers, it is doubtful whether the CAW
Legal Services Plan and other similar prepaid
plans will beneﬁt lawyers and clients in the long
run.

The primary purpose of the passage is to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

compare and contrast legal plans with the
traditional way of paying for legal services
explain the growing popularity of legal plans
trace the effect of legal plans on prices of legal
services
caution that increased use of legal plans is
potentially harmful to the legal profession and
to clients
advocate reforms to legal plans as presently
constituted

The passage most strongly suggests that, according to
proponents of prepaid legal plans, cooperating lawyers
beneﬁt from taking clients at lower fees in which one
of the following ways?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Lawyers can expect to gain expertise in a wide
variety of legal services by availing themselves
of the access to diverse clientele that plan
participation affords.
Experienced cooperating lawyers are likely to
enjoy the higher proﬁts of long-term, complex
cases, for which new lawyers are not suited.
Lower rates of proﬁt will be offset by a higher
volume of clients and new business through
word-of-mouth recommendations.
Lower fees tend to attract clients away from
established, nonparticipating law ﬁrms.
With all legal fees moving downward to match
the plans’ schedules, the profession will respond
to market forces.

According to the passage, which one of the following
is true of CAW Legal Services Plan members?

simple and routine matters.
They must pay a fee above the cost of
membership for the services of an outside

In the ﬁeld of historiography—the writing of
history based on a critical examination of authentic
primary information sources—one area that has
recently attracted attention focuses on the responses
of explorers and settlers to new landscapes in order to
provide insights into the transformations the
landscape itself has undergone as a result of
settlement. In this endeavor historiographers
examining the history of the Paciﬁc Coast of the
United States have traditionally depended on the
records left by European American explorers of the
nineteenth century who, as commissioned agents of
the U.S. government, were instructed to report
thoroughly their ﬁndings in writing.
But in furthering this investigation some
historiographers have recently recognized the need
to expand their deﬁnition of what a source is. They
maintain that the sources traditionally accepted as
documenting the history of the Paciﬁc Coast have too
often omitted the response of Asian settlers to this
territory. In part this is due to the dearth of written
records left by Asian settlers; in contrast to the
commissioned agents, most of the people who ﬁrst
came to western North America from Asia during this
same period did not focus on developing a selfconscious written record of their involvement with
the landscape. But because a full study of a culture’s
historical relationship to its land cannot conﬁne itself
to a narrow record of experience, these
historiographers have begun to recognize the value of
other kinds of evidence, such as the actions of Asian
settlers.
As a case in point, the role of Chinese settlers in
expanding agriculture throughout the Paciﬁc Coast
territory is integral to the history of the region.
Without access to the better Sand, Chinese settlers
looked for agricultural potential in this generally arid
region where other settlers did not. For example,
where settlers of European descent looked at willows
and saw only useless, untillable swamp, Chinese
settlers saw fresh water, fertile soil, and the potential
for bringing water to more arid areas via irrigation.
Where other settlers who looked at certain weeds,
such as wild mustard, generally saw a nuisance,
Chinese settlers saw abundant raw material for
valuable spices from a plant naturally suited to the
local soil and climate.
Given their role in the labor force shaping this
territory in the nineteenth century, the Chinese settlers
offered more than just a new view of the land. Their
vision was reinforced by specialized skills involving
swamp reclamation and irrigation systems, which
helped lay the foundation for the now well-known
and prosperous agribusiness of the region. That
80 percent of the area’s cropland is now irrigated and
that the region is currently the top producer of many
specialty crops cannot be fully understood by
historiographers without attention to the input of
Chinese settlers as reconstructed from their
interactions with that landscape.

Which one of the following most accurately states the
main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

9.

The history of settlement along the Paciﬁc
Coast of the U.S., as understood by most
historiographers, is conﬁrmed by evidence
reconstructed from the actions of Asian settlers.
Asian settlers on the Paciﬁc Coast of the U.S.
left a record of their experiences that traditional
historiographers believed to be irrelevant.
To understand Asian settlers’ impact on the
history of the Paciﬁc Coast of the U.S.,
historiographers have had to recognize the
value of nontraditional kinds of historiographic
evidence.
Spurred by new ﬁndings regarding Asian
settlement on the Paciﬁc Coast of the U.S.
historiographers have begun to debate the
methodological foundations of historiography.
By examining only written information,
historiography as it is traditionally practiced has
produced inaccurate historical accounts.

Which one of the following most accurately describes
the author’s primary purpose in discussing Chinese
settlers in the third paragraph?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

to suggest that Chinese settlers followed typical
settlement patterns in this region during the
nineteenth century
to argue that little written evidence of Chinese
settlers’ practices survives
to provide examples illustrating the unique view
Asian settlers had of the land
to demonstrate that the history of settlement in
the region has become a point of contention
among historiographers
to claim that the historical record provided by
the actions of Asian settlers is inconsistent with
history as derived from traditional sources

10. The passage states that the primary traditional
historiographic sources of information about the history
of the Paciﬁc Coast of the U.S. have which one of the
following characteristics?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

They were written both before and after Asian
settlers arrived in the area.
They include accounts by Native Americans in
the area.
They are primarily concerned with potential
agricultural uses of the land.
They focus primarily on the presence of water
sources in the region.
They are accounts left by European American
explorers.

11. The author would most likely disagree with which one
of the following statements?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Examining the actions not only of Asian settlers
but of other cultural groups of the Paciﬁc Coast
of the U.S. is necessary to a full understanding
of the impact of settlement on the landscape
there.
The signiﬁcance of certain actions to the writing
of history may be recognized by one group of
historiographers but not another.
Recognizing the actions of Asian settlers adds to
but does not complete the writing of the history
of the Paciﬁc Coast of the U.S.
By recognizing as evidence the actions of people,
historiographers expand the deﬁnition of what a
source is.
The expanded deﬁnition of a source will
probably not be relevant to studies of regions
that have no signiﬁcant immigration of nonEuropeans.

12. According to the passage, each of the following was an
aspect of Chinese settlers’ initial interactions with the
landscape of the Paciﬁc Coast of the U.S. EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

new ideas for utilizing local plants
a new view of the land
specialized agricultural skills
knowledge of agribusiness practices
knowledge of irrigation systems

13. Which one of the following can most reasonably be
inferred from the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Most Chinese settlers came to the Paciﬁc Coast
of the U.S. because the climate was similar to
that with which they were familiar.
Chinese agricultural methods in the nineteenth
century included knowledge of swamp
reclamation.
Settlers of European descent used wild mustard
seed as a spice.
Because of the abundance of written sources
available, it is not worthwhile to examine the
actions of European settlers.
What written records were left by Asian settlers
were neglected and consequently lost to
scholarly research.

14. Which one of the following, if true, would most help to
strengthen the author’s main claim in the last sentence
of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Market research of agribusinesses owned by
descendants of Chinese settlers shows that
the market for the region’s specialty crops has
grown substantially faster than the market for
any other crops in the last decade.
Nineteenth-century surveying records indicate
that the lands now cultivated by specialty crop
businesses owned by descendants of Chinese
settlers were formerly swamp lands.
Research by university agricultural science
departments proves that the formerly arid lands
now cultivated by large agribusinesses contain
extremely fertile soil when they are sufﬁciently
irrigated.
A technological history tracing the development
of irrigation systems in the region reveals that
their efﬁciency has increased steadily since the
nineteenth century.
Weather records compiled over the previous
century demonstrate that the weather patterns
in the region are well-suited to growing certain
specialty crops as long as they are irrigated.

The survival of nerve cells, as well as their
performance of some specialized functions, is
regulated by chemicals known as neurotrophic
factors, which are produced in the bodies of animals,
including humans. Rita Levi-Montalcini’s discovery
in the 1950s of the ﬁrst of these agents, a
hormonelike substance now known as NGF, was a
crucial development in the history of biochemistry,
which led to Levi-Montalcini sharing the Nobel Prize
for medicine in 1986.
In the mid-1940s, Levi-Montalcini had begun by
hypothesizing that many of the immature nerve cells
produced in the development of an organism are
normally programmed to die. In order to conﬁrm this
theory, she conducted research that in 1949 found
that, when embryos are in the process of forming
their nervous systems, they produce many more
nerve cells than are ﬁnally required, the number that
survives eventually adjusting itself to the volume of
tissue to be supplied with nerves. A further phase of
the experimentation, which led to Levi-Montalcini’s
identiﬁcation of the substance that controls this
process, began with her observation that the
development of nerves in chick embryos could be
stimulated by implanting a certain variety of mouse
tumor in the embryos. She theorized that a chemical
produced by the tumors was responsible for the
observed nerve growth. To investigate this hypothesis,
she used the then new technique of tissue culture, by
which speciﬁc types of body cells can be made to
grow outside the organism from which they are
derived. Within twenty-four hours, her tissue cultures
of chick embryo extracts developed dense halos of
nerve tissue near the places in the culture where she
had added the mouse tumor. Further research
identiﬁed a speciﬁc substance contributed by the
mouse tumors that was responsible for the effects
Levi-Montalcini had observed: a protein that she
named “nerve growth factor” (NGF).
NGF was the ﬁrst of many cell-growth factors to
be found in the bodies of animals. Through LeviMontalcini’s work and other subsequent research, it
has been determined that this substance is present in
many tissues and biological ﬂuids, and that it is
especially concentrated in some organs. In developing
organisms, nerve cells apparently receive this growth
factor locally from the cells of muscles or other
organs to which they will form connections for
transmission of nerve impulses, and sometimes from
supporting cells intermingled with the nerve tissue.
NGF seems to play two roles, serving initially to
direct the developing nerve processes toward the
correct, speciﬁc “target” cells with which they must
connect, and later being necessary for the continued
survival of those nerve cells. During some periods of
their development, the types of nerve cells that are
affected by NGF—primarily cells outside the brain
and spinal cord—die if the factor is not present or if
they encounter anti-NGF antibodies.

15. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Levi-Montalcini’s discovery of neurotrophic
factors as a result of research carried out in
the 1940s was a major contribution to our
understanding of the role of naturally occurring
chemicals, especially NGF, in the development
of chick embryos.
Levi-Montalcini’s discovery of NGF, a
neurotrophic factor that stimulates the
development of some types of nerve tissue and
whose presence or absence in surrounding cells
helps determine whether particular nerve cells
will survive, was a pivotal development in
biochemistry.
NGF, which is necessary for the survival and
proper functioning of nerve cells, was
discovered by Levi-Montalcini in a series of
experiments using the technique of tissue
culture, which she devised in the 1940s.
Partly as a result of Levi-Montalcini’s research, it
has been found that NGF and other neurotrophic
factors are produced only by tissues to which
nerves are already connected and that the
presence of these factors is necessary for the
health and proper functioning of nervous
systems.
NGF, a chemical that was discovered by LeviMontalcini, directs the growth of nerve cells
toward the cells with which they must connect
and ensures the survival of those nerve cells
throughout the life of the organism except when
the organism produces anti-NGF antibodies.

16. Based on the passage, the author would be most likely
to believe that Levi-Montalcini’s discovery of NGF is
noteworthy primarily because it
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

paved the way for more speciﬁc knowledge of
the processes governing the development of the
nervous system
demonstrated that a then new laboratory
technique could yield important and
unanticipated experimental results
conﬁrmed the hypothesis that many of a
developing organism’s immature nerve cells are
normally programmed to die
indicated that this substance stimulates
observable biochemical reactions in the tissues
of different species
identiﬁed a speciﬁc substance, produced by
mouse tumors, that can be used to stimulate
nerve cell growth

which one of the following hypotheses?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

20. Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information in the passage?
(A)

18. Information in the passage most strongly supports
which one of the following?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Nerve cells in excess of those that are needed by
the organism in which they develop eventually
produce anti-NGF antibodies to suppress the
effects of NGF.
Nerve cells that grow in the absence of NGF are
less numerous than, but qualitatively identical
to, those that grow in the presence of NGF.
Few of the nerve cells that connect with target
cells toward which NGF directs them are
needed by the organism in which they develop.
Some of the nerve cells that grow in the presence
of NGF are eventually converted to other types
of living tissue by neurotrophic factors.
Some of the nerve cells that grow in an embryo
do not connect with any particular target cells.

A certain kind of mouse tumor produces a
chemical that stimulates the growth of nerve
cells.
Developing embryos initially grow many more
nerve cells than they will eventually require.
In addition to NGF, there are several other
important neurotrophic factors regulating cell
survival and function.
Certain organs contain NGF in concentrations
much higher than in the surrounding tissue.
Certain nerve cells are supplied with NGF by the
muscle cells to which they are connected.

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Some of the effects that the author describes as
occurring in Levi-Montalcini’s culture of chick
embryo extract were due to neurotrophic factors
other than NGF.
Although NGF was the ﬁrst neurotrophic factor
to be identiﬁed, some other such factors are now
more thoroughly understood.
In her research in the 1940s and 1950s, LeviMontalcini identiﬁed other neurotrophic factors
in addition to NGF.
Some neurotrophic factors other than NGF
perform functions that are not speciﬁcally
identiﬁed in the passage.
The effects of NGF that Levi-Montalcini noted in
her chick embryo experiment are also caused by
other neurotrophic factors not discussed in the
passage.

The proponents of the Modern Movement in
architecture considered that, compared with the
historical styles that it replaced, Modernist
architecture more accurately reﬂected the functional
spirit of twentieth-century technology and was
better suited to the newest building methods. It is
ironic, then, that the Movement fostered an ideology
of design that proved to be at odds with the way
buildings were really built.
The tenacious adherence of Modernist architects
and critics to this ideology was in part responsible for
the Movement’s decline. Originating in the 1920s as a
marginal, almost bohemian art movement, the Modern
Movement was never very popular with the public,
but this very lack of popular support produced
in Modernist architects a high-minded sense of
mission—not content merely to interpret the needs of
the client, these architects now sought to persuade, to
educate, and, if necessary, to dictate. By 1945 the
tenets of the Movement had come to dominate
mainstream architecture, and by the early 1950s, to
dominate architectural criticism—architects whose
work seemed not to advance the evolution of the
Modern Movement tended to be dismissed by
proponents of Modernism. On the other hand, when
architects were identiﬁed as innovators—as was the
case with Otto Wagner, or the young Frank Lloyd
Wright—attention was drawn to only those features
of their work that were “Modern”; other aspects were
conveniently ignored.
The decline of the Modern Movement later in the
twentieth century occurred partly as a result of
Modernist architects’ ignorance of building methods,
and partly because Modernist architects were
reluctant to admit that their concerns were chieﬂy
aesthetic. Moreover, the building industry was
evolving in a direction Modernists had not
anticipated: it was more specialized and the process
of construction was much more fragmented than in
the past. Up until the twentieth century, construction
had been carried out by a relatively small number of
tradespeople, but as the building industry evolved,
buildings came to be built by many specialized
subcontractors working independently. The architect’s
design not only had to accommodate a sequence of
independent operations, but now had to reﬂect the
allowable degree of inaccuracy of the different trades.
However, one of the chief construction ideals of the
Modern Movement was to “honestly” expose
structural materials such as steel and concrete. To do
this and still produce a visually acceptable interior
called for an unrealistically high level of
craftmanship. Exposure of a building’s internal
structural elements, if it could be achieved at all,
could only be accomplished at considerable cost—

(60)

hence the well-founded reputation of Modern
architecture as prohibitively expensive.
As Postmodern architects recognized, the need to
expose structural elements imposed unnecessary
limitations on building design. The unwillingness of
architects of the Modern Movement to abandon their
ideals contributed to the decline of interest in the
Modern Movement.

21. Which one of the following most accurately
summarizes the main idea of the passage?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The Modern Movement declined because its
proponents were overly ideological and did
not take into account the facts of building
construction.
Rationality was the theoretical basis for the
development of the Modern Movement in
architecture.
Changes in architectural design introduced by the
Modern Movement inspired the development of
modern construction methods.
The theoretical bases of the Modern Movement
in architecture originated in changes in building
construction methods.
Proponents of the Modern Movement in
architecture rejected earlier architectural styles
because such styles were not functional.

22. Which one of the following is most similar to the
relationship described in the passage between the
new methods of the building industry and pretwentieth-century construction?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Clothing produced on an assembly line is less
precisely tailored than clothing produced by a
single garment maker.
Handwoven fabric is more beautiful than fabric
produced by machine.
Lenses ground on a machine are less useful than
lenses ground by hand.
Form letters produced by a word processor elicit
fewer responses than letters typed individually
on a typewriter.

24. It can be inferred that the author of the passage
believes which one of the following about Modern
Movement architects’ ideal of exposing structural
materials?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The repudiation of the ideal by some of these
architects undermined its validity.
The ideal was rarely achieved because of its lack
of popular appeal.
The ideal was unrealistic because most builders
were unwilling to attempt it.
The ideal originated in the work of Otto Wagner
and Frank Lloyd Wright.
The ideal arose from aesthetic rather than
practical concerns.

25. Which one of the following, in its context in the
passage, most clearly reveals the attitude of the author
toward the proponents of the Modern Movement?

the young Frank Lloyd Wright (lines 27-28) primarily
as examples of
(A)

(D)
(E)

innovative architects whose work was not
immediately appreciated by the public
architects whom proponents of the Modern
Movement claimed represented the movement
architects whose work helped to popularize the
Modern Movement
architects who generally attempted to interpret
the needs of their clients, rather than dictating to

25 Questions

Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1.

The tidal range at a particular location is the difference
in height between high tide and low tide. Tidal studies
have shown that one of the greatest tidal ranges in the
world is found in the Bay of Fundy and reaches more
than seventeen meters. Since the only forces involved
in inducing the tides are the sun’s and moon’s gravity,
the magnitudes of tidal ranges also must be explained
entirely by gravitational forces.
Which one of the following most accurately describes a
ﬂaw in the reasoning above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

2.

It gives only one example of a tidal range.
It fails to consider that the size of a tidal range
could be affected by the conditions in which
gravitational forces act.
It does not consider the possibility that low tides
are measured in a different way than are high
tides.
It presumes, without providing warrant, that most
activity within the world’s oceans is a result of
an interplay of gravitational forces.
It does not differentiate between the tidal effect
of the sun and the tidal effect of the moon.

Cardiologist: Coronary bypass surgery is commonly
performed on patients suffering from coronary
artery disease when certain other therapies
would be as effective. Besides being relatively
inexpensive, these other therapies pose less risk
to the patient since they are less intrusive. Bypass
surgery is especially debatable for single-vessel
disease.
The cardiologist’s statements, if true, most strongly
support which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Bypass surgery is riskier than all alternative
therapies.
Needless bypass surgery is more common today
than previously.
Bypass surgery should be performed when more
than one vessel is diseased.
Bypass surgery is an especially expensive
therapy when used to treat single-vessel disease.
Sometimes there are equally effective
alternatives to bypass surgery that involve less
risk.

3.

In the past, combining children of different ages in one
classroom was usually a failure; it resulted in confused
younger children, who were given inadequate attention
and instruction, and bored older ones, who had to sit
through previously learned lessons. Recently, however,
the practice has been revived with excellent results.
Mixed-age classrooms today are stimulating to older
children and enable younger children to learn much
more efﬁciently than in standard classrooms.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent discrepancy in the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

On average, mixed-age classrooms today are
somewhat larger in enrollment than were the
ones of the past.
Mixed-age classrooms of the past were better
equipped than are those of today.
Today’s mixed-age classrooms, unlike those
of the past, emphasize group projects that are
engaging to students of different ages.
Today’s mixed-age classrooms have students of a
greater range of ages than did those of the past.
Few of the teachers who are reviving mixed-age
classrooms today were students in mixed-age
classrooms when they were young.

The top 50 centimeters of soil on Tiliga Island contain
bones from the native birds eaten by the islanders since
the ﬁrst human immigration to the island 3,000 years
ago. A comparison of this top layer with the underlying
150 centimeters of soil—accumulated over 80,000
years—reveals that before humans arrived on Tiliga, a
much larger and more diverse population of birds lived
there. Thus, the arrival of humans dramatically
decreased the population and diversity of birds on
Tiliga.

6.

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)
5.

The bird species known to have been eaten by the
islanders had few natural predators on Tiliga.
Many of the bird species that disappeared from
Tiliga did not disappear from other, similar,
uninhabited islands until much later.
The arrival of a species of microbe, carried
by some birds but deadly to many others,
immediately preceded the ﬁrst human
immigration to Tiliga.
Bones from bird species known to have been
eaten by the islanders were found in the
underlying 150 centimeters of soil.
The birds that lived on Tiliga prior to the ﬁrst
human immigration generally did not ﬂy well.

The corpus callosum—the thick band of nerve ﬁbers
connecting the brain’s two hemispheres—of a musician
is on average larger than that of a nonmusician. The
differences in the size of corpora callosa are particularly
striking when adult musicians who began training
around the age of seven are compared to adult
nonmusicians. Therefore, musical training, particularly
when it begins at a young age, causes certain anatomic
brain changes.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The corpora callosa of musicians, before they
started training, do not tend to be larger than
those of nonmusicians of the same age.
Musical training late in life does not cause
anatomic changes to the brain.
For any two musicians whose training began
around the age of seven, their corpora callosa
are approximately the same size.
All musicians have larger corpora callosa than do
any nonmusicians.
Adult nonmusicians did not participate in
activities when they were children that would
have stimulated any growth of the corpus
callosum.

Chai: The use of the word “tree” to denote both
deciduous and coniferous plant forms, while
acceptable as a lay term, is scientiﬁcally
inadequate; it masks the fact that the two plant
types have utterly different lineages.
Dodd: But the common name highlights the crucial fact
that both are composed of the same material and
have very similar structures; so it is acceptable as
a scientiﬁc term.
The conversation provides the strongest grounds for
holding that Chai and Dodd disagree over whether

Which one of the following statements, if true, most
seriously weakens the argument?
(A)

2

2 2

(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

7.

it is advisable to use ordinary terms as names for
biological forms in scientiﬁc discourse
using the same term for two biological forms
with different lineages can be scientiﬁcally
acceptable
both deciduous and coniferous plant forms
evolved from simpler biological forms
it is important that the lay terms for plant forms
reﬂect the current scientiﬁc theories about them
biological forms with similar structures can have
different lineages

Increases in the occurrence of hearing loss among
teenagers are due in part to their listening to loud
music through stereo headphones. So a group of
concerned parents is recommending that headphone
manufacturers include in their product lines stereo
headphones that automatically turn off when a
dangerous level of loudness is reached. It is clear that
adoption of this recommendation would not
signiﬁcantly reduce the occurrence of hearing loss in
teenagers, however, since almost all stereo headphones
that teenagers use are bought by the teenagers
themselves.
Which one of the following, if true, provides the most
support for the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Loud music is most dangerous to hearing when it
is played through stereo headphones.
No other cause of hearing loss in teenagers is as
damaging as their listening to loud music
through stereo headphones.
Parents of teenagers generally do not themselves
listen to loud music through stereo headphones.
Teenagers who now listen to music at
dangerously loud levels choose to do so despite
their awareness of the risks involved.
A few headphone manufacturers already plan to
market stereo headphones that automatically
turn off when a dangerous level of loudness is
reached.

8.

Most plants have developed chemical defenses against
parasites. The average plant contains about 40 natural
pesticides—chemical compounds toxic to bacteria,
fungi, and other parasites. Humans ingest these natural
pesticides without harm every day. Therefore, the
additional threat posed by synthetic pesticides sprayed
on crop plants by humans is minimal.
Each of the following, if true, weakens the argument
EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

9.

Humans have been consuming natural plant
pesticides for millennia and have had time to
adapt to them.
The concentrations of natural pesticides in
plants are typically much lower than the
concentrations of synthetic pesticides in sprayed
crop plants.
Natural plant pesticides are typically less potent
than synthetic pesticides, whose toxicity is
highly concentrated.
Natural plant pesticides generally serve only
as defenses against speciﬁc parasites, whereas
synthetic pesticides are often harmful to a wide
variety of organisms.
The synthetic pesticides sprayed on crop plants
by humans usually have chemical structures
similar to those of the natural pesticides
produced by the plants.

In addition to the labor and materials used to make
wine, the reputation of the vineyard where the grapes
originate plays a role in determining the price of the
ﬁnished wine. Therefore, an expensive wine is not
always a good wine.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The price of a bottle of wine should be a
reﬂection of the wine’s quality.
Price is never an accurate indication of the
quality of a bottle of wine.
The reputation of a vineyard does not always
indicate the quality of its wines.
The reputation of a vineyard generally plays
a greater role than the quality of its grapes in
determining its wines’ prices.
Wines produced by lesser-known vineyards
generally are priced to reﬂect accurately the
wines’ quality.

10. Before their larvae hatch, each parental pair of
Nicrophorus beetles buries the carcass of a small
vertebrate nearby. For several days after the larvae
hatch, both beetles feed their voracious larvae from the
carcass, which is entirely consumed within a week.
Since both parents help with feeding, larvae should
beneﬁt from both parents’ presence; however, removing
one parent before the hatching results in larvae that
grow both larger and heavier than they otherwise
would be.
Which one of the following, if true, best helps to
explain why removing one parent resulted in larger,
heavier larvae?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Two beetles can ﬁnd and bury a larger carcass
than can a single beetle.
Both parents use the carcass as their own food
supply for as long as they stay with the larvae.
Beetle parents usually take turns feeding their
larvae, so that there is always one provider
available and one at rest.
After a week, the larvae are capable of ﬁnding
other sources of food and feeding themselves.
Two parents can defend the carcass from attack
by other insects better than a single parent can.

11. For many centuries it was believed that only classical
Euclidean geometry could provide a correct way of
mathematically representing the universe. Nevertheless,
scientists have come to believe that a representation of
the universe employing non-Euclidean geometry is
much more useful in developing certain areas of
scientiﬁc theory. In fact, such a representation underlies
the cosmological theory that is now most widely
accepted by scientists as accurate.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the statements above?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Scientists who use Euclidean geometry are likely
to believe that progress in mathematical theory
results in progress in natural science.
Scientists generally do not now believe that
classical Euclidean geometry is uniquely
capable of giving a correct mathematical
representation of the universe.
Non-Euclidean geometry is a more complete way
of representing the universe than is Euclidean
geometry.
An accurate scientiﬁc theory cannot be
developed without the discovery of a uniquely
correct way of mathematically representing the
universe.
The usefulness of a mathematical theory is now
considered by scientists to be more important
than its mathematical correctness.

12. Experts hired to testify in court need to know how to
make convincing presentations. Such experts are
evaluated by juries in terms of their ability to present
the steps by which they arrived at their conclusions
clearly and conﬁdently. As a result, some less expert
authorities who are skilled at producing convincing
testimony are asked to testify rather than highly
knowledgeable but less persuasive experts.
Which one of the following most closely conforms to
the principle illustrated by the passage above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Successful politicians are not always the ones
who best understand how to help their country.
Some lack insight into important political issues
but are highly skilled at conducting an election
campaign.
Trial lawyers often use the techniques employed
by actors to inﬂuence the emotions of jurors.
Many lawyers have studied drama expressly for
the purpose of improving their courtroom skills.
The opera singer with the best voice is the
appropriate choice even for minor roles, despite
the fact that an audience may be more affected
by a singer with greater dramatic ability but a
lesser voice.
It is often best to try to train children with gentle
reinforcement of desired behavior, rather than
by simply telling them what to do and what
not to do. This results in children who behave
because they want to, not because they feel
compelled.
Job applicants are usually hired because their
skills and training best meet a recognized set
of qualiﬁcations. Only rarely is a prospective
employer convinced to tailor a position to suit
the skills of a particular applicant.

13. The solution to any environmental problem that is not
the result of government mismanagement can only lie in
major changes in consumer habits. But major changes
in consumer habits will occur only if such changes
are economically enticing. As a result, few serious
ecological problems will be solved unless the solutions
are made economically enticing.
The conclusion drawn in the argument above follows
logically if which one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Few serious ecological problems are the result of
government mismanagement.
No environmental problems that stem from
government mismanagement have solutions that
are economically feasible.
Major changes in consumer habits can be made
economically enticing.
Most environmental problems that are not the
result of government mismanagement are major
ecological problems.
Few serious ecological problems can be solved
by major changes in consumer habits.

14. The economy is doing badly. First, the real estate slump
has been with us for some time. Second, car sales are
at their lowest in years. Of course, had either one or
the other phenomenon failed to occur, this would be
consistent with the economy as a whole being healthy.
But, their occurrence together makes it quite probable
that my conclusion is correct.
Which one of the following inferences is most strongly
supported by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

If car sales are at their lowest in years, then it is
likely that the economy is doing badly.
If the economy is doing badly, then either the
real estate market or the car sales market is not
healthy.
If the real estate market is healthy, then it is
likely that the economy as a whole is healthy.
If the economy is in a healthy state, then it is
unlikely that the real estate and car sales
markets are both in a slump.
The bad condition of the economy implies that
both the real estate and the car sales markets are
doing badly.

15. According to current geological theory, the melting of
ice at the end of the Ice Age signiﬁcantly reduced the
weight pressing on parts of the earth’s crust. As a
result, lasting cracks in the earth’s crust appeared in
some of those parts under the stress of pressure from
below. At the end of the Ice Age Sweden was racked
by severe earthquakes. Therefore, it is likely that the
melting of the ice contributed to these earthquakes.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The earth’s crust tends to crack whenever there is
a sudden change in the pressures affecting it.
There are various areas in Northern Europe that
show cracks in the earth’s crust.
Evidence of severe earthquakes around the time
of the end of the Ice Age can be found in parts
of northern Canada.
Severe earthquakes are generally caused by
cracking of the earth’s crust near the earthquake
site.
Asteroid impacts, which did occur at the end of
the Ice Age, generally cause severe earthquakes.

16. Sociologist: Some economists hold that unregulated
markets should accompany democratic
sovereignty because they let people vote with
their money. But this view ignores the crucial
distinction between the private consumer and the
public citizen. In the marketplace the question
is, “What do I want?” At the voting booth the
question is always, “What do we want?” Hence,
supporters of political democracy can also support
marketplace regulation.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn by the sociologist?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Voters think of themselves as members of a
community, rather than as isolated individuals.
Unregulated markets are incompatible with
democratic sovereignty.
Where there is democratic sovereignty there
should be unregulated markets.
Private consumers are primarily concerned with
their own self-interest.
Opposition to unregulated markets is consistent
with support for democracy.

17. The tiny hummingbird weighs little, but its egg is 15
percent of the adult hummingbird’s weight. The volume
and weight of an adult goose are much greater than
those of a hummingbird, but a goose’s egg is only about
4 percent of its own weight. An adult ostrich, much
larger and heavier than a goose, lays an egg that is only
1.6 percent of its own weight.
Which one of the following propositions is best
illustrated by the statements above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The eggs of different bird species vary widely in
their ratio of volume to weight.
The smaller and lighter the average adult
members of a bird species are, the larger and
heavier the eggs of that species are.
The ratio of egg weight of a species to body
weight of an adult member of that species is
smaller for larger birds than for smaller ones.
The size of birds’ eggs varies greatly from
species to species but has little effect on the
volume and weight of the adult bird.
Bird species vary more in egg size than they do
in average body size and weight.

18. Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula portrayed
vampires—the “undead” who roam at night to suck
the blood of living people—as able to turn into bats.
As a result of the pervasive inﬂuence of this novel,
many people now assume that a vampire’s being able
to turn into a bat is an essential part of vampire myths.
However, this assumption is false, for vampire myths
existed in Europe long before Stoker’s book.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

At least one of the European vampire myths that
predated Stoker’s book did not portray vampires
as strictly nocturnal.
Vampire myths in Central and South America,
where real vampire bats are found, portray
vampires as able to turn into bats.
Vampire myths did not exist outside Europe
before the publication of Stoker’s Dracula.
At least one of the European vampire myths that
predated Stoker’s book did not portray vampires
as able to turn into bats.
At the time he wrote Dracula, Stoker was
familiar with earlier European vampire myths.

19. It is unlikely that the world will ever be free of
disease. Most diseases are caused by very proliﬁc
microorganisms whose response to the pressures
medicines exert on them is predictable: they quickly
evolve immunities to those medicines while maintaining
their power to infect and even kill humans.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the argument by the claim that it is
unlikely that the world will ever be free of disease?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

It is a conclusion that is claimed to follow from
the premise that microorganisms are too
numerous for medicines to eliminate entirely.
It is a conclusion for which a description of the
responses of microorganisms to the medicines
designed to cure the diseases they cause is
offered as support.
It is a premise offered in support of the claim
that most disease-causing microorganisms are
able to evolve immunities to medicines while
retaining their ability to infect humans.
It is a generalization used to predict the response
of microorganisms to the medicines humans use
to kill them.
It is a conclusion that is claimed to follow from
the premise that most microorganisms are
immune to medicines designed to kill them.

20. Scientist: My research indicates that children who
engage in impulsive behavior similar to adult
thrill-seeking behavior are twice as likely as other
children to have a gene variant that increases
sensitivity to dopamine. From this, I conclude
that there is a causal relationship between this
gene variant and an inclination toward thrillseeking behavior.
Which one of the following, if true, most calls into
question the scientist’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Many impulsive adults are not unusually
sensitive to dopamine.
It is not possible to reliably distinguish impulsive
behavior from other behavior.
Children are often described by adults as
engaging in thrill-seeking behavior simply
because they act impulsively.
Many people exhibit behavioral tendencies as
adults that they did not exhibit as children.
The gene variant studied by the scientist is
correlated with other types of behavior in
addition to thrill-seeking behavior.

21. It is highly likely that Claudette is a classical pianist.
Like most classical pianists, Claudette recognizes many
of Clara Schumann’s works. The vast majority of
people who are not classical pianists do not. In fact,
many people who are not classical pianists have not
even heard of Clara Schumann.
The reasoning in the argument above is ﬂawed in that it

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

ignores the possibility that Claudette is more
familiar with the works of other composers of
music for piano

classical pianists cannot also play other musical
instruments

who recognize many of Clara Schumann’s
works are not classical pianists

22. All the evidence so far gathered ﬁts both Dr. Grippen’s
theory and Professor Heissmann’s. However, the
predictions that these theories make about the result of
the planned experiment cannot both be true. Therefore,
the result of this experiment will conﬁrm one of these
theories at the expense of the other.
The argument above exhibits an erroneous pattern of
reasoning most similar to that exhibited by which one
of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

David and Jane both think they know how to
distinguish beech trees from elms, but when
they look at trees together they often disagree.
Therefore, at least one of them must have an
erroneous method.
Although David thinks the tree they saw was
a beech, Jane thinks it was an elm. Jane’s
description of the tree’s features is consistent
with her opinion, so this description must be
inconsistent with David’s view.
David and Jane have been equally good at
identifying trees so far. But David says this one
is an elm, whereas Jane is unsure. Therefore,
if this tree turns out to be an elm, we’ll know
David is better.
David thinks that there are more beeches than
elms in this forest. Jane thinks he is wrong. The
section of forest we examined was small, but
examination of the whole forest would either
conﬁrm David’s view or disprove it.
David thinks this tree is a beech. Jane thinks it is
an elm. Maria, unlike David or Jane, is expert
at tree identiﬁcation, so when Maria gives her
opinion it will verify either David’s or Jane’s
opinion.

23. Columnist: The relief from the drudgery of physical
labor that much modern technology affords its
users renders them dependent on this technology,
and, more importantly, on the elaborate energy
systems required to run it. This leads to a loss of
self-sufﬁciency. Clearly, then, in addition to
undermining life’s charm, much modern
technology diminishes the overall well-being of its
users.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the columnist’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Physical labor is essential to a fulﬁlling life.
Self-sufﬁciency contributes to a person’s wellbeing.
People are not free if they must depend on
anything other than their own capacities.
Anything causing a loss in life’s charm is
unjustiﬁable unless this loss is compensated by
some gain.
Technology inherently limits the well-being of its
users.

24. Psychologist: Some psychologists mistakenly argue
that because dreams result from electrical
discharges in the brain, they must be understood
purely in terms of their physiological function.
They conclude, against Freud, that dreams reveal
nothing about the character of the dreamer. But
since dream content varies enormously, then even
if electrical discharges provide the terms of the
physiological explanation of dreams, they cannot
completely explain the phenomenon of dreaming.
The claim that dream content varies enormously plays
which one of the following roles in the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

It is used to support the anti-Freudian conclusion
that some psychologists draw concerning
dreams.
It is used to support the explicitly stated
conclusion that a fully satisfactory account of
dreams must allow for the possibility of their
revealing signiﬁcant information about the
dreamer.
It is used to suggest that neither Freud’s theory
nor the theory of anti-Freudian psychologists
can completely explain the phenomenon of
dreaming.
It is used to illustrate the difﬁculty of providing a
complete explanation of the phenomenon of
dreaming.
It is used to undermine a claim that some
psychologists use to argue against a view of
Freud’s.

25. The ﬁrst bicycle, the Draisienne, was invented in 1817.
A brief fad ensued, after which bicycles practically
disappeared until the 1860s. Why was this? New
technology is accepted only when it coheres with the
values of a society. Hence some change in values must
have occurred between 1817 and the 1860s.
The reasoning in the argument is ﬂawed because the
argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

presumes, without giving justiﬁcation, that fads
are never indicative of genuine acceptance
fails to recognize that the reappearance of
bicycles in the 1860s may have indicated
genuine acceptance of them
offers no support for the claim that the
Draisienne was the ﬁrst true bicycle
poses a question that has little relevance to the
argument’s conclusion
ignores, without giving justiﬁcation, alternative
possible explanations of the initial failure of
bicycles

26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1.

Jones fell unconscious on the job and it was suspected
that he had swallowed a certain chemical, so he was
rushed to the local hospital’s emergency room. In
making her diagnosis, the emergency-room physician
knew that if Jones had swallowed the chemical, a
deﬁciency in the content of a mineral in his blood
would result. She also knew that deﬁciency in the
mineral causes inﬂammation of the skin. Since Jones’s
skin was not inﬂamed when he was admitted to the
emergency room, the physician concluded that Jones
had not swallowed the chemical.

3.

Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the statements above, if those statements are true?

Which one of the following, if true, would undermine
the physician’s conclusion?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Jones did not know that the chemical was
dangerous.
Jones had suffered inﬂammation of the skin in
the past.
It takes 48 hours for the chemical to bring about
deﬁciency of the mineral in the blood.
Jones often worked with the chemical.
Deﬁciency in minerals other than the mineral in
question can cause inﬂammation of the skin.

Beginning in the 1950s, popular music was
revolutionized by the electriﬁcation of musical
instruments, which has enabled musicians to play
with increased volume. Because individual musicians
can play with increased volume, the average number
of musicians per band has decreased. Nevertheless,
electriﬁcation has increased rather than decreased the
overall number of musicians who play popular music
professionally.

The number of amateur musicians who play
popular music has decreased.
Most professional musicians are able to play
both electric and nonelectric instruments.
The number of professional musicians in some
bands has increased.
The total number of professional bands has
increased as a result of electriﬁcation.
Many professional musicians play in more than
one band.

Paciﬁst: It is immoral to do anything that causes harm
to another person. But, since using force causes
harm to another person, it is also immoral to
threaten to use force, even when such a threat is
made in self-defense.

Statistics indicating a sudden increase in the incidence
of a problem often merely reﬂect a heightened
awareness of the problem or a greater ability to record
its occurrence. Hence we should be wary of proposals
for radical solutions to problems when those proposals
are a reaction to new statistical data.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, would
most help to justify the paciﬁst’s reasoning?

The argumentation conforms most closely to which one
of the following principles?

(A)

(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Given the potential harm caused by the use of
force, the line between use of force in selfdefense and the aggressive use of force is
always vague.
It is immoral to threaten to do what it is immoral
to do.
It is immoral to do anything that causes more
harm than good.
Whether a threat made in self-defense is immoral
depends on the circumstances.
It is immoral to carry out a threat if making the
threat is itself immoral.

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A better cognizance of a problem does not
warrant the undertaking of a radical solution to
the problem.
Attempts to stop the occurrence of a problem
should be preceded by a determination that the
problem actually exists.
Proposals for radical solutions to problems
should be based on statistical data alone.
Statistical data should not be manipulated to
make a radical solution to a problem seem more
justiﬁed than it actually is.
Radical solutions to problems can cause other
problems and end up doing more harm than
good.

5. Barr: The National Tea Association cites tea’s recent
visibility in advertising and magazine articles as
evidence of tea’s increasing popularity. However,
a neutral polling company, the Survey Group, has
tracked tea sales at numerous stores for the last 20
years and has found no change in the amount of
tea sold. We can thus conclude that tea is no more
popular now than it ever was.

The National Tea Association has announced that
it plans to carry out its own retail survey in the
next year.
A survey by an unrelated polling organization
shows that the public is generally receptive to
the idea of trying new types of tea.
The Survey Group is funded by a consortium of
consumer advocacy groups.
The stores from which the Survey Group
collected information about tea sales are all
located in the same small region of the country.
Tea has been the subject of an expensive and
efﬁcient advertising campaign funded, in part,
by the National Tea Association.

Doctors urge people to reduce their cholesterol levels
through dietary changes. But moderate dietary changes
often do not work to lower cholesterol levels. One may
need, therefore, to make more dramatic changes, such
as switching to a vegetarian diet.
The statement that moderate dietary changes often do
not work to lower cholesterol levels plays which one of
the following roles in the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is presented to counter doctors’ suggestions
that cholesterol levels can be reduced through
dietary changes.
It is a premise offered in support of the claim
that vegetarian diets are more healthful than any
diets containing meat.
It is a premise offered in support of the claim that
reducing cholesterol levels may require greater
than moderate dietary changes.
It is offered as an explanation of the success of
vegetarian diets in reducing cholesterol levels.
It is a conclusion for which the claim that
dramatic changes in one’s diet are sometimes
required to reduce cholesterol levels is offered
as support.

Since empathy is essential for people to be willing to
follow moral codes that sometimes require them to
ignore their own welfare to help others, civilized society
could not exist without empathy.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)

Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens Barr’s argument?
(A)

4

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)
8.

Civilized society can exist only if there are
people who are willing to at least sometimes
ignore their own welfare to help others.
Failure to empathize with other people usually
leads to actions detrimental to civilized society.
If everyone in a society is sometimes willing to
ignore his or her own welfare to help others,
that society will be civilized.
Moral codes that include the requirement that
people disregard their own welfare in order to
help others have arisen within some civilized
societies.
People who feel empathy tend to ignore their
own welfare for the sake of others.

Insurgent political parties that are profoundly
dissatisﬁed with the dominant party’s reign and
justiﬁcatory ideology always produce factions whose
views and aims differ as greatly from each other’s as
they do from the dominant party’s. Although these
factions ignore their own disagreements for the sake of
defeating the dominant party, their disagreements
inevitably come forward upon victory.
Therefore, ______.
Which one of the following is the most logical
completion of the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

no victorious insurgent party ever manages
to stay in power for as long as the party it
displaces did
a victorious insurgent party must address the
disagreements between its factions if it is to stay
in power
the heretofore insurgent party will not always
promulgate a new ideology to justify its own
policies, once it is victorious
a victorious insurgent party always faces
opposition from the party it recently ousted
it is impossible for the different factions of
a victorious insurgent party to effect the
compromises necessary to keep the new party in
power

Manager: When Sullivan was passed over for
promotion, people said that the deciding factor
was his being much older than the competition.
But this is clearly not the case. Several recent
promotions have been given to people older than
Sullivan.

(D)
(E)

Sullivan was well qualiﬁed for the promotion
age is only one of a number of factors that kept

10. Council member P: Alarmists are those who see an
instance of pollution and exaggerate its
signiﬁcance into a major character fault of society.
Such alarmists fail to distinguish the incident and
the behavior that caused it from the disposition of
people not to pollute.
Council member Q: To think that there is a lot of
pollution based on the discovery of a serious
single instance of pollution is simply an
application of the widely accepted principle that
actions tend to follow the path of least resistance,
and it is surely easier to pollute than not to pollute.
Council members P and Q disagree over whether
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

pollution should be considered a problem
actions tend to follow the path of least resistance
people are responsible for pollution
people can change their behavior and not pollute
people are inclined to pollute

11. It is easy to see that the board of directors of the
construction company is full of corruption and should
be replaced. There are many instances of bribery by
various persons on the staff of board member Wagston
that are a matter of public record. These bribes
perniciously inﬂuenced the awarding of government
contracts.
The argument’s reasoning is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the argument fails to show that corruption is not
limited to Wagston’s staff
the argument fails to show that Wagston’s staff
engaged in any bribery other than bribery of
government ofﬁcials
the argument fails to specify the relation between
bribery and corruption
the argument presumes without giving
justiﬁcation that all of Wagston’s staff have
engaged in corruption
the argument attempts to deﬂect attention away
from substantive issues by attacking the
character of the board

12. Coffee and tea contain methylxanthines, which cause
temporary increases in the natural production of
vasopressin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland.
Vasopressin causes clumping of blood cells, and the
clumping is more pronounced in women than in men.
This is probably the explanation of the fact that women
face as much as a tenfold higher risk than men do of
complications following angioplasty, a technique used
to clear clogged arteries.
Which one of the following statements is most strongly
supported by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Men, but not women, should be given
methylxanthines prior to undergoing
angioplasty.
In spite of the risks, angioplasty is the only
effective treatment for clogged arteries.
Women probably drink more coffee and tea, on
average, than do men.
Prior to undergoing angioplasty, women should
avoid coffee and tea.
Angioplasty should not be used to treat clogged
arteries.

13. Whether a machine performs its intended function is
plain for all to see, but recognition of excellence in
art requires a rare subtlety of perception. So whereas
engineers usually maintain their composure when their
work is being evaluated, artists tend to become anxious
under such circumstances.
The reasoning above conforms most closely to which
one of the following propositions?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

People who have an interest in working as artists
are no more likely to have especially anxious
personalities than are people who have an
interest in working as engineers.
The value of a machine is independent of the
feelings of those who create it, while the value
of an artwork is not.
Evaluation of the work of engineers should be
based on a different set of standards than is
evaluation of the work of artists.
People who create things whose success can
be easily ascertained worry less about others’
opinions of their work than do people who
create things whose value cannot be easily
ascertained.
Someone who creates a work that cannot be
easily evaluated tends to be less conﬁdent about
its value than are those who evaluate it.

14. Scientists hypothesize that a particular type of fat
known as “P-fat” is required for the development of
eyesight. Researchers were led to this hypothesis by
observing that babies who are fed formulas low in P-fat
tend to have worse eyesight than babies fed mother’s
milk, which is high in P-fat. It has also been shown that
babies that are ﬁve to six weeks premature tend to have
worse eyesight than babies carried to term.

15. Artists have different ways of producing contours
and hatching, and analysis of these stylistic features
can help to distinguish works by a famous artist both
from forgeries and from works genuinely by other
artists. Indeed, this analysis has shown that many of
the drawings formerly attributed to Michelangelo are
actually by the artist Giulio Clovio, Michelangelo’s
contemporary.
If the statements above are true, then which one of the
following must also be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the moralist’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(A)

(C)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Contours and hatching are the main features
that distinguish the drawing styles of different
artists.
Many of the drawings formerly attributed to
Michelangelo are actually forgeries.
No forgery can perfectly duplicate the contour
and hatching styles of a famous artist.
The contour and hatching styles used to identify
the drawings of Clovio cited can be shown to be
features of all Clovio’s works.
There is an analyzable difference between
Clovio’s contour and hatching styles and those
of Michelangelo.

16. Moralist: Immoral actions are those that harm other
people. But since such actions eventually harm
those who perform them, those who act immorally
do so only through ignorance of some of their
actions’ consequences rather than through a
character defect.

Which one of the following, if true, most supports the
scientists’ hypothesis?
Adults whose diets lack P-fat tend to have worse
eyesight than those whose diets are high in Pfat.
A fetus typically receives high levels of P-fat
from the mother during only the last four weeks
of pregnancy.
Babies whose mothers have poor eyesight do not
tend to have poor eyesight themselves.
Babies generally prefer mother’s milk to
formulas low in P-fat.
The eyesight of a fetus develops during the last
trimester of pregnancy.

4

(D)
(E)

People ignorant of their actions’ consequences
cannot be held morally responsible for those
consequences.
An action harms those who perform it only if it
also eventually harms others.
Only someone with a character defect would
knowingly perform actions that eventually harm
others.
Those who, in acting immorally, eventually harm
themselves do not intend that harm.
None of those who knowingly harm themselves
lack character defects.

17. Climatologists believe they know why Earth has
undergone a regular sequence of ice ages beginning
around 800,000 years ago. Calculations show that
Earth’s orbit around the Sun has ﬂuctuations that
coincide with the ice-age cycles. The climatologists
hypothesize that when the ﬂuctuations occur, Earth
passes through clouds of cosmic dust that enters the
atmosphere; the cosmic dust thereby dims the Sun,
resulting in an ice age. They concede, however, that
though cosmic dust clouds are common, the clouds
would have to be particularly dense in order to have this
effect.

19. Political scientist: All governments worthy of respect
allow their citizens to dissent from governmental
policies. No government worthy of respect leaves
minorities unprotected. Thus any government that
protects minorities permits criticism of its
policies.
The ﬂawed pattern of reasoning in which one of the
following most closely parallels that in the political
scientist’s argument?
(A)

Each of the following, if true, would lend support to the
climatologists’ hypothesis EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Earth did not pass through clouds of cosmic dust
earlier than 800,000 years ago.
Two large asteroids collided 800,000 years
ago, producing a tremendous amount of dense
cosmic dust that continues to orbit the Sun.
Earth’s average temperature drops slightly
shortly after volcanic eruptions spew large
amounts of dust into Earth’s atmosphere.
Large bits of cosmic rock periodically enter
Earth’s atmosphere, raising large amounts of
dust from Earth’s surface.
Rare trace elements known to be prevalent in
cosmic debris have been discovered in layers of
sediment whose ages correspond very closely to
the occurrence of ice ages.

18. Philosopher: The rational pursuit of happiness is
quite different from always doing what one most
strongly desires to do. This is because the rational
pursuit of happiness must include consideration
of long-term consequences, whereas our desires
are usually focused on the short term. Moreover,
desires are sometimes compulsions, and while
ordinary desires result in at least momentary
happiness when their goals are attained,
compulsions strongly drive a person to pursue
goals that offer no happiness even when reached.
If all of the philosopher’s statements are true, each of
the following could be true EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The majority of people do not have compulsions.
Attaining the goal of any desire results in
momentary happiness.
Most people do not pursue happiness rationally.
Most people want more than their own personal
happiness.
All actions have long-term consequences.

Politicians are admirable if they put the interests
of those they serve above their own interests. So
politicians who sometimes ignore the interests
of their own constituents in favor of the nation
as a whole deserve admiration, for they are
putting the interests of those they serve above
their own.
All jazz musicians are capable of improvising
and no jazz musician is incapable of reading
music. Therefore all musicians who can read
music can improvise.
Ecosystems with cool, dry climates are populated
by large mammals. No ecosystems populated by
large mammals have abundant and varied plant
life. Thus ecosystems that do not have cool, dry
climates have abundant and varied plant life.
Some intellectuals are not socially active, and no
intellectual is a professional athlete. Therefore
any professional athlete is socially active.
First-person narratives reveal the thoughts of
the narrator but conceal those of the other
characters. Some third-person narratives reveal
the motives of every character. Thus books that
rely on making all characters’ motives apparent
should be written in the third person.

20. Advertisement: Each of the Economic Merit Prize
winners from the past 25 years is covered by the
Acme retirement plan. Since the winners of the
nation’s most prestigious award for economists
have thus clearly recognized that the Acme
plan offers them a ﬁnancially secure future, it is
probably a good plan for anyone with retirement
needs similar to theirs.
The advertisement’s argumentation is most vulnerable
to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It ignores the possibility that the majority of
Economic Merit Prize winners from previous
years used a retirement plan other than the
Acme plan.
It fails to address adequately the possibility that
any of several retirement plans would be good
enough for, and offer a ﬁnancially secure future
to, Economic Merit Prize winners.
It appeals to the fact that supposed experts have
endorsed the argument’s main conclusion,
rather than appealing to direct evidence for that
conclusion.
It takes for granted that some winners of the
Economic Merit Prize have deliberately selected
the Acme retirement plan, rather than having
had it chosen for them by their employers.
It presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
each of the Economic Merit Prize winners has
retirement plan needs that are identical to the
advertisement’s intended audience’s retirement
plan needs.

21. A small car offers less protection in an accident
than a large car does, but since a smaller car is more

argument above?
(A)

(E)

An artist’s best work is generally that done in the
time before the artist becomes very well known.
When artists grow famous and are diverted
from artistic creation by demands for public
appearances, their artistic work suffers. So
artists’ achieving great fame can diminish their
artistic reputations.
It is best to insist that a child spend at least some
time every day reading indoors. Even though it
may cause the child some unhappiness to have
to stay indoors when others are outside playing,
the child can beneﬁt from the time by learning
to enjoy books and becoming prepared for
lifelong learning.
For this work, vehicles built of lightweight
materials are more practical than vehicles built
of heavy materials. This is so because while
lighter vehicles do not last as long as heavier
vehicles, they are cheaper to replace.
Although it is important to limit the amount of
sugar and fat in one’s diet, it would be a mistake
to try to follow a diet totally lacking in sugar
and fat. It is better to consume sugar and fat in
moderation, for then the cravings that lead to
uncontrolled binges will be prevented.
A person who exercises vigorously every day
has less body fat than an average person to draw
upon in the event of a wasting illness. But one
should still endeavor to exercise vigorously
every day, because doing so signiﬁcantly
decreases the chances of contracting a wasting
illness.

22. Trainer: Research shows that when dogs are neutered
in early puppyhood, their leg bones usually do not
develop properly. Improper bone development
leads in turn to problems with arthritis as dogs
grow older. Thus, if you want to protect your dog
from arthritis you should not neuter your dog until
it is full-grown.
Of the following, which one is a criticism to which the
reasoning in the trainer’s argument is most vulnerable?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It fails to state exactly what percentage of
dogs neutered in early puppyhood experience
improper bone development.
It fails to explain the connection between
improper bone development and arthritis.
It fails to address the effects of neutering in
middle or late puppyhood.
It fails to consider the possibility that the beneﬁts
of neutering a dog early might outweigh the risk
of arthritis.
It fails to consider the possibility that dogs with
properly developed bones can develop arthritis.

23. Political scientist: One of the most interesting
dilemmas in contemporary democratic politics
concerns the regulation of political campaign
spending. People certainly should be free, within
broad limits, to spend their money as they choose.
On the other hand, candidates who can vastly
outspend all rivals have an unfair advantage
in publicizing their platforms. Democratic
governments have a strong obligation to ensure
that all voices have an equal chance to be heard,
but governments should not subsidize expensive
campaigns for each candidate. The resolution of
the dilemma, therefore, is clear: __________.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the political scientist’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

only candidates with signiﬁcant campaign
resources should be permitted to run for public
ofﬁce
an upper limit on the political campaign spending
of each candidate is warranted
government subsidization of all political
campaigns at a low percentage of their total cost
is warranted
all wealthy persons should be prohibited
from spending their own money on political
campaigns
each candidate should be allowed to spend as
much money on a political campaign as any
other candidate chooses to spend

24. Some people have maintained that private ownership
of the means of production ultimately destroys any
society that sanctions it. This may be true of a less
technologically advanced society that must share
its economic resources to survive. But since only
private ownership of the means of production permits
individuals to test new technologies without the
majority’s consent, a technologically advanced society
will actually endanger its survival if the means of
production become public property.
The proposition that private ownership of the means
of production ultimately destroys any society that
sanctions it plays which one of the following roles in
the argument above?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

It is a generalization that the argument suggests
is no more applicable to less technologically
advanced societies than to more technologically
advanced societies.
It is a hypothesis for whose widespread
acceptance the argument offers an explanation.
It is a general hypothesis that the argument
suggests is inapplicable to societies more
dependent for survival upon the introduction
of new technologies than upon the sharing of
resources.
It is a contention about the consequences of an
economic arrangement that the argument claims
is incompatible with the needs of any society.
It is a generalization about societies that
according to the argument is true for any society
in which the majority of its citizens does not
impede the introduction of new technologies.

25. A certain medication that is frequently prescribed to
lower a patient’s cholesterol level is generally effective.
A recent study of 1,000 subjects ranging widely in age
indicates, however, that the cholesterol level of
someone taking the medication is typically 12 to 15
percent higher than the average for that person’s age
group.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain how both of the claims made above could be
true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

A recently developed cholesterol-lowering
medication is more effective than the
medication described above.
Another medication is prescribed to treat high
cholesterol just as often as the medication
described above is.
In most cases, people with high cholesterol levels
are not treated with drug therapy but are put on
restrictive low-cholesterol diets.
The medication described above is usually
prescribed only for people whose cholesterol
level is at least 30 percent above the average for
their age group.
Within the population as a whole, approximately
the same number of people have relatively
high cholesterol levels as have relatively low
cholesterol levels.

26. Political theorist: For all of its members to be strong
in foreign policy, an alliance of countries must
respond aggressively to problems. An alliance
will do so only if every member of the alliance
perceives the problems as grave. But the European
Union countries will not all perceive a problem as
grave unless they all agree that it threatens their
alliance’s economy. Thus, not all of the member
countries of the European Union will be strong in
foreign policy.
The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Countries that refuse to join alliances generally
respond more aggressively to problems than do
countries that do join alliances.
Countries become less aggressive in foreign
policy if greater wealth leads them to think
that they have more to lose by responding to
problems aggressively.
Problems that appear to some member countries
of the European Union to threaten the alliance’s
economy will not appear so to others.
European Union member countries that fail to
perceive the economic relevance of problems
are generally weak in foreign policy.
Alliances that are economically beneﬁcial for a
given country are not necessarily beneﬁcial with
regard to foreign policy.
