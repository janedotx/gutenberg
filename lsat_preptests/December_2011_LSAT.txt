SECTION I
Time—35 minutes
25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. In a recent study of more than 400 North American men
and women whose previous heart attack put them at risk
for a second heart attack, about half were told to switch
to a “Mediterranean-type diet”—one rich in fish,
vegetables, olive oil, and grains—while the other half
were advised to eat a more traditional “Western” diet
but to limit their fat intake. Those following the
Mediterranean diet were significantly less likely than
those in the other group to have a second heart attack.
But the Mediterranean diet includes a fair amount of fat
from fish and olive oil, so the research suggests that a
diet may not have to be extremely low in fat in order to
protect the heart.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Research has shown that eliminating almost all
fat from one’s diet can be effective in decreasing
the likelihood of a second heart attack.
Studies suggest that the kinds of oils in the fat
included in the Mediterranean diet may protect
the heart against potentially fatal disruptions of
heart rhythms and other causes of heart attacks.
The patients who consumed the Mediterranean
diet enjoyed the food and continued to follow
the diet after the experiment was concluded.
Many people who have had heart attacks are
advised by their cardiologists to begin an exercise
regimen in addition to changing their diet.
Some cardiologists believe that the protection
afforded by the Mediterranean diet might be
enhanced by drugs that lower blood-cholesterol
levels.

2. Florist: Some people like to have green carnations on
St. Patrick’s Day. But flowers that are naturally
green are extremely rare. Thus, it is very difficult
for plant breeders to produce green carnations.
Before St. Patrick’s Day, then, it is wise for
florists to stock up on white carnations, which are
fairly inexpensive and quite easy to dye green.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the overall conclusion of the florist’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is a good idea for florists to stock up on
white carnations before St. Patrick’s Day.
Flowers that are naturally green are very rare.
There are some people who like to have green
carnations on St. Patrick’s Day.
White carnations are fairly inexpensive and can
easily be dyed green.
It is very difficult to breed green carnations.

3. Millions of homes are now using low-energy lighting,
but millions more have still to make the switch, a fact
that the government and the home lighting industry are
eager to change. Although low-wattage bulbs cost more
per bulb than normal bulbs, their advantages to the
homeowner are enormous, and therefore everyone should
use low-wattage bulbs.
Information about which one of the following would be
LEAST useful in evaluating the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the actual cost of burning low-wattage bulbs
compared to that of burning normal bulbs
the profits the home lighting industry expects to
make from sales of low-wattage bulbs
the specific cost of a low-wattage bulb
compared with that of a normal bulb
the opinion of current users of low-wattage
bulbs as to their effectiveness
the average life of a low-wattage bulb compared
with that of a normal bulb

4. Swimming pools should be fenced to protect children
from drowning, but teaching children to swim is even
more important. And there is a principle involved here
that applies to childrearing generally. Thus, while we
should restrict children’s access to the soft drinks and
candies advertised on television shows directed towards
children, it is even more important to teach them _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

that television can be a good source of accurate
information about many things
that television advertisements are deceptive and
misleading
how to make nutritional choices that are
conducive to their well-being
the importance of physical activity to health and
well-being
how to creatively entertain themselves without
watching television

5. In its coverage of a controversy regarding a proposal to
build a new freeway, a television news program showed
interviews with several people who would be affected
by the proposed freeway. Of the interviews shown,
those conducted with people against the new freeway
outnumbered those conducted with people for it two to
one. The television program is therefore biased against
the proposed freeway.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most of the people who watched the program
were aware of the freeway controversy
beforehand.
Most viewers of television news programs do
not expect those programs to be completely
free of bias.
In the interviews, the people against the new
freeway expressed their opinions with more
emotion than the people for the freeway did.
Before the program aired, over twice as many
people were against building the freeway than
were in favor of it.
The business interests of the television station
that produced the program would be harmed
by the construction of a new freeway.

6. Evan: I am a vegetarian because I believe it is immoral
to inflict pain on animals to obtain food. Some
vegetarians who share this moral reason nonetheless
consume some seafood, on the grounds that it is
not known whether certain sea creatures can
experience pleasure or pain. But if it is truly
wrong to inflict needless suffering, we should
extend the benefit of the doubt to sea animals and
refrain from eating seafood.
Which one of the following most closely conforms to
the principle illustrated by Evan’s criticism of vegetarians
who eat seafood?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

I do not know if I have repaid Farah the money
she lent me for a movie ticket. She says that
she does not remember whether or not I repaid
her. In order to be sure that I have repaid her,
I will give her the money now.
It is uncertain whether all owners of the defective
vehicles know that their vehicles are being
recalled by the manufacturer. Thus, we should
expect that some vehicles that have been
recalled have not been returned.
I am opposed to using incentives such as
reduced taxes to attract businesses to our region.
These incentives would attract businesses
interested only in short-term profits. Such
businesses would make our region’s economy
less stable, because they have no long-term
commitment to the community.
Updating our computer security system could
lead to new contracts. The present system has
no problems, but we could benefit from
emphasizing a state-of-the-art system in new
proposals. If we do not get new customers,
the new system could be financed through
higher fees for current customers.
Isabel Allende lived through the tragic events of
her country’s recent history; no doubt her
novels have been inspired by her memories of
those events. Yet Allende’s characters are
hopeful and full of joy, indicating that Allende’s
own view of life has not been negatively
marked by her experiences.

7. Economist: Government intervention in the free market
in pursuit of socially desirable goals can affect
supply and demand, thereby distorting prices. The
ethics of such intervention is comparable to that
of administering medicines. Most medicines have
harmful as well as beneficial effects, so the use of
a type of medicine is ethically justified only when
its nonuse would be significantly more harmful
than its use. Similarly, government intervention in
the free market is justified only when it _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the final sentence above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

would likely be approved of by the majority of
the affected participants
has been shown to have few if any significantly
harmful effects
is believed unlikely to significantly exacerbate
any existing problems
would do less damage than would result from
the government’s not intervening
provides a solution to some otherwise insoluble
problem

8. The proportion of fat calories in the diets of people who
read the nutrition labels on food products is significantly
lower than it is in the diets of people who do not read
nutrition labels. This shows that reading these labels
promotes healthful dietary behavior.
The reasoning in the argument above is flawed in that
the argument
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

illicitly infers a cause from a correlation
relies on a sample that is unlikely to be
representative of the group as a whole
confuses a condition that is necessary for a
phenomenon to occur with a condition that is
sufficient for that phenomenon to occur
takes for granted that there are only two possible
alternative explanations of a phenomenon
draws a conclusion about the intentions of a
group of people based solely on data about the
consequences of their behavior

9. Some paleontologists have suggested that Apatosaurus,
a huge dinosaur, was able to gallop. This, however, is
unlikely, because galloping would probably have broken
Apatosaurus’s legs. Experiments with modern bones
show how much strain they can withstand before
breaking. By taking into account the diameter and
density of Apatosaurus leg bones, it is possible to
calculate that those bones could not have withstood the
strains of galloping.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn by the argument as a whole?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Galloping would probably have broken the legs
of Apatosaurus.
It is possible to calculate that Apatosaurus leg
bones could not have withstood the strain of
galloping.
The claim of paleontologists that Apatosaurus
was able to gallop is likely to be incorrect.
If galloping would have broken the legs of
Apatosaurus, then Apatosaurus was probably
unable to gallop.
Modern bones are quite similar in structure and
physical properties to the bones of Apatosaurus.

10. A new process enables ordinary table salt to be fortified
with iron. This advance could help reduce the high
incidence of anemia in the world’s population due to a
deficiency of iron in the diet. Salt is used as a preservative
for food and a flavor enhancer all over the globe, and
people consume salt in quantities that would provide
iron in significant amounts.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the argument by the statement that
people consume salt in quantities that would provide
iron in significant amounts?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is the conclusion of the argument.
It provides support for the conclusion of the
argument.
It is a claim that the argument is directed
against.
It qualifies the conclusion of the argument.
It illustrates a principle that underlies the
argument.

11. Inspector: The only fingerprints on the premises are
those of the owner, Mr. Tannisch. Therefore,
whoever now has his guest’s missing diamonds
must have worn gloves.
Which one of the following exhibits a flaw in its
reasoning most similar to that in the inspector’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The campers at Big Lake Camp, all of whom
became ill this afternoon, have eaten food only
from the camp cafeteria. Therefore, the cause
of the illness must not have been something
they ate.
The second prototype did not perform as well in
inclement weather as did the first prototype.
Hence, the production of the second prototype
might have deviated from the design followed
for the first.
Each of the swimmers at this meet more often
loses than wins. Therefore, it is unlikely that
any of them will win.
All of Marjorie’s cavities are on the left side of
her mouth. Hence, she must chew more on the
left side than on the right.
All of these tomato plants are twice as big as
they were last year. So if we grow peas, they
will probably be twice as big as last year’s peas.

12. Populations of a shrimp species at eleven different
Indonesian coral reefs show substantial genetic
differences from one reef to another. This is surprising
because the area’s strong ocean currents probably carry
baby shrimp between the different reefs, which would
allow the populations to interbreed and become genetically
indistinguishable.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the substantial genetic differences among the
shrimp populations?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The genetic differences between the shrimp
populations are much less significant than
those between shrimp and any other marine
species.
The individual shrimp within a given population
at any given Indonesian coral reef differ from
one another genetically, even though there is
widespread interbreeding within any such
population.
Before breeding, shrimp of the species
examined migrate back to the coral reef at
which they were hatched.
Most shrimp hatched at a given Indonesian
coral reef are no longer present at that coral
reef upon becoming old enough to breed.
Ocean currents probably carry many of the baby
shrimp hatched at a given Indonesian coral
reef out into the open ocean rather than to
another coral reef.

13. Researchers have studied the cost-effectiveness of growing
halophytes—salt-tolerant plant species—for animal
forage. Halophytes require more water than conventional
crops, but can be irrigated with seawater, and pumping
seawater into farms near sea level is much cheaper than
pumping freshwater from deep wells. Thus, seawater
agriculture near sea level should be cost-effective in
desert regions although its yields are smaller than
traditional, freshwater agriculture.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument above?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

A given volume of halophytes is significantly
different in nutritional value for animal forage
from the same volume of conventional forage
crops.
Some halophytes not only tolerate seawater but
require salt in order to thrive.
Large research expenditures are needed to
develop the strains of halophytes best suited
for agricultural purposes.
Costs other than the costs of irrigation are
different for halophytes grown by means of
seawater irrigation than for conventional crops.
Pumping water for irrigation is proportionally
one of the largest costs involved in growing,
harvesting, and distributing any forage crop
for animals.

14. Principle: If an insurance policy is written in such a way
that a reasonable person seeking insurance would
not read it thoroughly before signing it, then the
reasonable expectations of the policyholder
concerning the policy’s coverage should take
legal precedence over specific language in the
written policy itself.
Application: The insurance company should be required
to cover the hail damage to Celia’s car, even
though specific language in the written policy
Celia signed excluded coverage for hail damage.
Which one of the following, if true, most justifies the
above application of the principle?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Celia is a reasonable person, and she expected
the insurance policy to cover hail damage to
her car.
Given the way it was written, a reasonable
person would not have read Celia’s insurance
policy thoroughly before signing it, and Celia
reasonably expected the policy to cover hail
damage.
The insurance policy that Celia signed was
written in such a way that a reasonable person
would not read it thoroughly before signing it,
but Celia did read the policy thoroughly before
signing it.
Celia did not read the insurance policy
thoroughly before signing it, and a reasonable
person in her position would assume that the
policy would cover hail damage.
Celia did not read the written insurance policy
thoroughly before signing it, and a reasonable
person in her position would not have done so
either.

15. Researcher: Every year approximately the same number
of people die of iatrogenic “disease”—that is, as
a direct result of medical treatments or
hospitalization—as die of all other causes combined.
Therefore, if medicine could find ways of
preventing all iatrogenic disease, the number of
deaths per year would decrease by half.
The reasoning in the researcher’s argument is flawed
because the argument fails to consider that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

prevention of noniatrogenic disease will have an
effect on the occurrence of iatrogenic disease
some medical treatments can be replaced by less
invasive or damaging alternatives
people who do not die of one cause may soon
die of another cause
there is no one way to prevent all cases of
death from iatrogenic disease
whenever a noniatrogenic disease occurs, there
is a risk of iatrogenic disease

16. Activist: Any member of the city council ought either to
vote against the proposal or to abstain. But if all
the members abstain, the matter will be decided
by the city’s voters. So at least one member of the
city council should vote against the proposal.
The conclusion of the activist’s argument follows
logically if which one of the following is assumed?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

If all the members of the city council abstain in
the vote on the proposal, the city’s voters will
definitely decide in favor of the proposal.
The proposal should not be decided by the
city’s voters.
No members of the city council will vote in
favor of the proposal.
If not every member of the city council abstains
in the vote on the proposal, the matter will not
be decided by the city’s voters.
If one member of the city council ought to vote
against the proposal, the other members should
abstain in the vote on the proposal.

17. Economist: Some critics of the media have contended
that negative news reports on the state of the
economy can actually harm the economy because
such reports damage people’s confidence in it,
and this lack of confidence in turn adversely
affects people’s willingness to spend money. But
studies show that spending trends correlate very
closely with people’s confidence in their own
immediate economic situations. Thus these media
critics are mistaken.
The economist’s argument is flawed in that it fails to
consider the possibility that
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

one’s level of confidence in one’s own economic
situation affects how one perceives reports
about the overall state of the economy
news reports about the state of the economy are
not always accurate
people who pay no attention to economic
reports in the media always judge accurately
whether their own economic situation is likely
to deteriorate or improve
people who have little confidence in the overall
economy generally take a pessimistic view
concerning their own immediate economic
situations
an economic slowdown usually has a greater
impact on the economic situations of individuals
if it takes people by surprise than if people are
forewarned

18. Zoologist: Every domesticated large mammal species
now in existence was domesticated thousands of
years ago. Since those days, people undoubtedly
tried innumerable times to domesticate each of the
wild large mammal species that seemed worth
domesticating. Clearly, therefore, most wild large
mammal species in existence today either would
be difficult to domesticate or would not be worth
domesticating.
The zoologist’s argument requires the assumption that
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

in spite of the difficulties encountered, at one
time or another people have tried to
domesticate each wild large mammal species
it is not much easier today to domesticate wild
large mammal species than it was in the past
not all of the large mammal species that were
domesticated in the past are still in existence
the easier it is to domesticate a wild large
mammal species, the more worthwhile it is to
do so
of all the domesticated large mammal species in
existence today, the very first to be
domesticated were the easiest to domesticate

19. Last winter was mild enough to allow most bird species
to forage naturally, which explains why the proportion
of birds visiting feeders was much lower than usual. The
mild winter also allowed many species to stay in their
summer range all winter without migrating south, thereby
limiting the usual attrition accompanying migration.
Hence, last year’s mild winter is responsible for this
year’s larger-than-usual bird population.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
strengthen the reasoning in the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Increases in bird populations sometimes occur
following unusual weather patterns.
When birds do not migrate south, the mating
behaviors they exhibit differ from those they
exhibit when they do migrate.
Birds eating at feeders are more vulnerable to
predators than are birds foraging naturally.
Birds that remain in their summer range all
winter often exhaust that range’s food supply
before spring.
Birds sometimes visit feeders even when they
are able to find sufficient food for survival by
foraging naturally.

20. Journalist: Newspapers generally report on only those
scientific studies whose findings sound dramatic.
Furthermore, newspaper stories about small
observational studies, which are somewhat
unreliable, are more frequent than newspaper stories
about large randomized trials, which generate
stronger scientific evidence. Therefore, a small
observational study must be more likely to have
dramatic findings than a large randomized trial.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses a
flaw in the journalist’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It casts doubt on the reliability of a study by
questioning the motives of those reporting it.
It fails to consider that even if a study’s
findings sound dramatic, the scientific evidence
for those findings may be strong.
It confuses a claim about scientific studies
whose findings sound dramatic with a similar
claim about small observational studies.
It overlooks the possibility that small
observational studies are far more common
than large randomized trials.
It fails to rule out the possibility that a study’s
having findings that sound dramatic is an
effect rather than a cause of the study’s being
reported on.

21. In several countries, to slow global warming, many
farmers are planting trees on their land because of
government incentives. These incentives arose from
research indicating that vegetation absorbs carbon
dioxide that might otherwise trap heat in the atmosphere.
A recent study, however, indicates that trees absorb and
store carbon dioxide less effectively than native grasses.
Therefore, these incentives are helping to hasten global
warming.
The argument requires the assumption that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

trees not only absorb carbon dioxide but also
emit it
most farmers do not plant any trees on their
land unless there is an incentive to do so
land that has been deforested seldom later
sustains native grasses
some of the trees planted in response to the
incentives are planted where native grasses
would otherwise be growing
few if any governments have been interested in
promoting the growth of native grasses

22. Does the position of a car driver’s seat have a significant
impact on driving safety? It probably does. Driving
position affects both comfort and the ability to see the
road clearly. A driver who is uncomfortable eventually
becomes fatigued, which makes it difficult to concentrate
on the road. Likewise, the better the visibility from the
driver’s seat, the more aware the driver can be of road
conditions and other vehicles.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the argument by the claim that driving
position affects both comfort and the ability to see the
road clearly?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is the conclusion drawn in the argument.
It is a claim that the argument shows to be
inconsistent with available evidence.
It is used to provide a causal explanation for an
observed phenomenon.
It describes evidence that the argument
ultimately refutes.
It is a premise offered in support of the
conclusion drawn in the argument.

23. Physician: There were approximately 83,400 trampolinerelated injuries last year. This suggests that
trampolines are quite dangerous and should
therefore be used only under professional
supervision.
Trampoline enthusiast: I disagree. In the past ten years
sales of home trampolines have increased much
more than trampoline-related injuries have:
260 percent in sales compared with 154 percent in
injuries. Every exercise activity carries risks, even
when carried out under professional supervision.
The dialogue provides the most support for the claim
that the physician and the trampoline enthusiast disagree
over whether
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

trampolines cause injuries to a significant
number of people using them
home trampolines are the main source of
trampoline-related injuries
the rate of trampoline-related injuries, in terms
of the number of injuries per trampoline user,
is declining
professional supervision of trampoline use tends
to reduce the number of trampoline-related
injuries
trampoline use is an activity that warrants
mandatory professional supervision

24. Editorial: One of our local television stations has been
criticized for its recent coverage of the personal
problems of a local politician’s nephew, but the
coverage was in fact good journalism. The
information was accurate. Furthermore, the
newscast had significantly more viewers than it
normally does, because many people are curious
about the politician’s nephew’s problems.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, would
most help to justify the reasoning in the editorial?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Journalism deserves to be criticized if it does
not provide information that people want.
Any journalism that intentionally misrepresents
the facts of a case deserves to be criticized.
Any journalism that provides accurate
information on a subject about which there is
considerable interest is good journalism.
Good journalism will always provide people
with information that they desire or need.
Journalism that neither satisfies the public’s
curiosity nor provides accurate information can
never be considered good journalism.

25. Interior decorator: All coffeehouses and restaurants are
public places. Most well-designed public places
feature artwork. But if a public place is
uncomfortable it is not well designed, and all
comfortable public places have spacious interiors.
If all of the interior decorator’s statements are true, then
which one of the following must be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Any restaurant that has a spacious interior is
comfortable.
Most public places that feature artwork are well
designed.
Most coffeehouses that are well designed
feature artwork.
Any well-designed coffeehouse or restaurant has
a spacious interior.
Any coffeehouse that has a spacious interior is
a well-designed public place.

In the 1980s there was a proliferation of poetry
collections, short stories, and novels published by
women of Latin American descent in the United
States. By the end of the decade, another genre of
U.S. Latina writing, the autobiography, also came into
prominence with the publication of three notable
autobiographical collections: Loving in the War Years:
Lo Que Nunca Pasó Por Sus Labios, by Cherríe
Moraga; Getting Home Alive, by Aurora Levins
Morales and Rosario Morales; and Borderlands/
La Frontera, by Gloria Anzaldúa.
These collections are innovative at many levels.
They confront traditional linguistic boundaries by
using a mix of English and Spanish, and they each
address the politics of multiple cultural identities by
exploring the interrelationships among such factors as
ethnicity, gender, and language. This effort manifests
itself in the generically mixed structure of these works,
which combine essays, sketches, short stories, poems,
and journal entries without, for the most part, giving
preference to any of these modes of presentation.
In Borderlands/La Frontera, Anzaldúa presents
her personal history and the history of the Mexican
American community to which she belongs by
juxtaposing narrative sequences and poetry. Moraga’s
Loving in the War Years is likewise characterized by
a mixture of genres, and, as she states in her
introduction, the events in her life story are not
arranged chronologically, but rather in terms of her
political development. According to one literary critic
who specializes in the genre of autobiography, this
departure from chronological ordering represents an
important difference between autobiographies written
by women and those traditionally written by men.
Getting Home Alive departs even further from the
conventions typical of autobiography by bringing
together the voices of two people, a mother and her
daughter, each of whom authors a portion of the text.
The narratives and poems of each author are not
assigned to separate sections of the text, but rather are
woven together, with a piece by one sometimes
commenting on a piece by the other. While this
ordering may seem fragmentary and confusing, it is
in fact a fully intentional and carefully designed
experiment with literary structure. In a sense, this
mixing of structures parallels the content of these
autobiographies: the writers employ multigeneric and
multivocal forms to express the complexities inherent
in the formation of their identities.
Rather than forcing their personal histories to
conform to existing generic parameters, these writers
have revolutionized the genre of autobiography,

(55)

redrawing the boundaries of this literary form to make
it more amenable to the expression of their own
experiences. In doing so, they have shown a strong
determination to speak for themselves in a world that
they feel has for too long taken their silence for
granted.

1. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Certain Latina writers who formerly wrote
mostly poetry and fiction have found through
experimentation that the genre of autobiography
suits their artistic purposes especially well.
Latina autobiographers writing in the late 1980s
set aside some standard conventions of
autobiography in an effort to make the genre
more suitable for the expression of their
personal histories.
There is a great diversity of styles and narrative
strategies among recent traditional and
nontraditional Latina autobiographers.
Through recent experimentation in
autobiography, Latina writers have shown
that nonfictional narrative can be effectively
combined with other genres in a single
literary work.
Recent writings by Latina authors have
prompted some literary critics who specialize
in autobiography to acknowledge that
differences in gender and ethnicity often
underlie differences in writing styles.

2. According to the passage, which one of the following
was a motivating factor in certain Latina authors’
decisions regarding the structure of their
autobiographical writings?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the importance of chronological ordering to
those authors’ artistic goals
those authors’ stated intention of avoiding
certain nonnarrative genres
those authors’ preference to avoid overt
political expression
the complexities of identity formation faced
by those authors
those authors’ judgment that poetry should
not be a narrative medium

historical document
confidence that it will be widely recognized
by scholars as a work of both history and
literary criticism
insistence that it should be credited with having
helped to broaden critics’ understanding of
what counts as autobiography

The events presented in an autobiography
should be arranged sequentially according to
when they actually happened.
When different modes of presentation are
combined in one literary work, no one mode
should be given preference.
Autobiographical writing should not have

Few autobiographical works published after
1985 have been recognized for their effective
use of chronologically linear prose as a means
of portraying the complexities of membership
in multiple cultures.
Few critically acclaimed books written by
Latina authors have been autobiographical
collections consisting partly or wholly of
essays, poems, short stories, sketches, and
journal entries.
Many autobiographies have been written by
authors in the United States since 1985, and
some of these present a unified, chronologically
linear prose narrative in a single language.
Several nineteenth-century autobiographies that
are generally unknown among contemporary
critics of twentieth-century autobiography are
characterized by generically mixed structure
and multiple authorship.
Several multigeneric, nonautobiographical
collections consisting at least partly of poetry,
short stories, or essays by Latina authors have
been published since 1985, and many of these
have been critically acclaimed for their
innovative structures.

While recent decades have seen more information
recorded than any other era, the potential for losing
this information is now greater than ever. This prospect
is of great concern to archivists, who are charged with
preserving vital records and documents indefinitely.
One archivist notes that while the quantity of material
being saved has increased exponentially, the durability
of recording media has decreased almost as rapidly.
The clay tablets that contain the laws of ancient
Mesopotamia, for example, are still displayed in
museums around the world, and many medieval
manuscripts written on animal parchment still look as
though they were copied yesterday, whereas books
printed on acidic paper as recently as the 1980s are
already unreadable. Black-and-white photographs
will last for a couple of centuries, but most color
photographs become unstable within 40 years, and
videotapes last only about 20 years.
Computer technology would seem to offer
archivists an answer, as maps, photographs, films,
videotapes, and all forms of printed material may now
be transferred to and stored electronically on computer
disks or tape, occupying very little space. But as the
pace of technological change increases, so too does
the speed with which each new generation of
technology supplants the last. For example, many
documents and images transferred in the 1980s to
optical computer disks—then the cutting edge of
technology—may not now be retrievable because
they depend on computer software and hardware that
are no longer available. And recent generations of
digital storage tape are considered safe from
deterioration for only ten years. Yet, even as some
archivists are reluctant to become dependent on
ever-changing computer technology, they are also
quickly running out of time.
Even if viable storage systems are developed—
new computer technologies are emerging that may
soon provide archivists with the information storage
durability they require—decisions about what to keep
and what to discard will have to be made quickly, as
materials recorded on conventional media continue to
deteriorate. Ideally, these decisions should be informed
by an assessment of the value of each document.
Printed versions of ancient works by Homer and
Virgil, for example, survived intact because their
enduring popularity resulted in multiple copies of the
works being made at different historical moments.
But many great works, including those of Plato, were
lost for several centuries and are known today only
because random copies turned up in the archives of
medieval monasteries or in other scholarly collections.
Undoubtedly, many important works have not survived
at all. The danger now is not so much that some recent
masterpiece will be lost for an extended period of
time, but rather that the sheer volume of accumulated
records stored on nondurable media will make it
virtually impossible for archivists to sort the essential
from the dispensable in time to save it.

8. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The increasing volume of information being
stored and the decreasing durability of modern
storage media are making it more and more
difficult for archivists to carry out their charge.
Modern data storage-and-retrieval techniques
have enabled archivists to distinguish essential
from dispensable information with greater
efficiency than ever before.
Many archivists have come to believe that
documents and images preserved on
conventional storage media are likely to
endure longer than those recorded on
electronic storage media.
Given the limitations on the capacity of modern
storage media, it is increasingly important for
archivists to save only those documents that
they believe to have genuine value.
Modern electronic media enable us to record
and store information so easily that much of
what is stored is not considered by archivists
to be essential or valuable.

which one of the following questions?

holds which one of the following views?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Archivists have little choice but to become
dependent on computer technology to store
information.
Archivists should wait for truly durable data
storage systems to be developed before
electronically storing any more vital information.
The problems concerning media durability
facing most archivists would diminish greatly
if their information were not stored
electronically at all.
Storing paintings, photographs, and other
images presents greater overall problems for
archivists than storing text does.
Generally, the more information one attempts to
store in a given amount of space, the less
durable the storage of that information will be.

11. Which one of the following describes the author’s
primary purpose in mentioning the fact that a wide
variety of images and documents can now be stored
electronically (lines 19–23)?
(A)

made in the first sentence of the passage
to identify an ostensible solution to the problem

which one of the following statements?
(A)

(B)

(D)

(E)

Information stored electronically is more
vulnerable than information stored on paper
to unauthorized use or theft.
Much of the information stored on optical
computer disks in the 1980s was subsequently
transferred to digital storage tape.
The high cost of new electronic data storage
systems is prohibiting many archivists from
transferring their archives to computer disks
and tape.
Media used recently to store information
electronically may ultimately be less durable
than older, conventional media such as
photographs and videotapes.
The percentage of information considered
essential by archivists has increased
proportionally as the amount of information
stored has increased.

13. The passage most strongly suggests that the author
holds which one of the following views?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Future electronic information storage systems
will not provide archivists with capabilities
any more viable in the long term than those
available today.
As much information should be stored by
archivists as possible, as there is no way to
predict which piece of information will
someday be considered a great work.
The general public has been misled by
manufacturers as to the long-term storage
capabilities of electronic information
storage systems.
Distinguishing what is dispensable from what
is essential has only recently become a concern
for archivists.
Value judgments made by today’s archivists
will influence how future generations view
and understand the past.

Passage A
In Canadian and United States common law,
blackmail is unique among major crimes: no one has
yet adequately explained why it ought to be illegal.
The heart of the problem—known as the blackmail
paradox—is that two acts, each of which is legally
permissible separately, become illegal when combined.
If I threaten to expose a criminal act or embarrassing
private information unless I am paid money, I have
committed blackmail. But the right to free speech
protects my right to make such a disclosure, and, in
many circumstances, I have a legal right to seek
money. So why is it illegal to combine them?
The lack of a successful theory of blackmail has
damaging consequences: drawing a clear line between
legal and illegal acts has proved impossible without
one. Consequently, most blackmail statutes broadly
prohibit behavior that no one really believes is criminal
and rely on the good judgment of prosecutors not to
enforce relevant statutes precisely as written.
It is possible, however, to articulate a coherent
theory of blackmail. The key to the wrongness of the
blackmail transaction is its triangular structure. The
blackmailer obtains what he wants by using a
supplementary leverage, leverage that depends upon
a third party. The blackmail victim pays to avoid
being harmed by persons other than the blackmailer.
For example, when a blackmailer threatens to turn in
a criminal unless paid money, the blackmailer is
bargaining with the state’s chip. Thus, blackmail is
criminal because it involves the misuse of a third party
for the blackmailer’s own benefit.
Passage B
Classical Roman law had no special category
for blackmail; it was not necessary. Roman jurists
began their evaluation of specific categories of
actions by considering whether the action caused
harm, not by considering the legality or illegality of
the action itself.
Their assumption—true enough, it seems—was
that a victim of blackmail would be harmed if shameful
but private information were revealed to the world.
And if the shame would cause harm to the person’s
status or reputation, then prima facie the threatened
act of revelation was unlawful. The burden of proof
shifted to the possessor of the information: the party
who had or threatened to reveal shameful facts had
to show positive cause for the privilege of revealing
the information.
In short, assertion of the truth of the shameful
fact being revealed was not, in itself, sufficient to
constitute a legal privilege. Granted, truth was not
wholly irrelevant; false disclosures were granted even
less protection than true ones. But even if it were true,
the revelation of shameful information was protected

3

3
(55)

only if the revelation had been made for a legitimate
purpose and dealt with a matter that the public
authorities had an interest in having revealed. Just
because something shameful happened to be true did
not mean it was lawful to reveal it.

14. Which one of the following is the central topic of
each passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

why triangular transactions are illegal
the role of the right to free speech in a given
legal system
how blackmail has been handled in a given
legal system
the history of blackmail as a legal concept
why no good explanation of the illegality of
blackmail exists

15. In using the phrase “the state’s chip” (line 29), the
author of passage A most clearly means to refer to
a government’s
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

legal authority to determine what actions
are crimes
legitimate interest in learning about crimes
committed in its jurisdiction
legitimate interest in preventing crimes before
they occur
exclusive reliance on private citizens as a
source of important information
legal ability to compel its citizens to testify in
court regarding crimes they have witnessed

16. Which one of the following statements is most strongly
supported by information given in the passages?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In Roman law, there was no blackmail paradox
because free speech protections comparable to
those in Canadian and U.S. common law were
not an issue.
Blackmail was more widely practiced in Roman
antiquity than it is now because Roman law
did not specifically prohibit blackmail.
In general, Canadian and U.S. common law
grant more freedoms than classical Roman
law granted.
The best justification for the illegality of
blackmail in Canadian and U.S. common law
is the damage blackmail can cause to the
victim’s reputation.
Unlike Roman law, Canadian and U.S.
common law do not recognize the interest of
public authorities in having certain types of
information revealed.

It combines two acts that are each legal
separately.
It is a transaction with a triangular structure.
The laws pertaining to it are meant to be

harmed by persons other than the blackmailer.
Canadian and U.S. common law have no
special category pertaining to blackmail.

18. Based on what can be inferred from the passages, which
one of the following acts would have been illegal under
Roman law, but would not be illegal under Canadian

(E)

bribing tax officials in order to avoid paying
taxes
revealing to public authorities that a highranking military officer has embezzled funds
from the military’s budget

deductions and exemptions; another country
legally allows relatively few deductions and
exemptions.
One country makes it illegal for felons to own
guns; another country has no such ban because
it makes gun ownership illegal for everyone
but police and the military.
One country makes it illegal to drive motorcycles
with racing-grade engines on its roads; another
country legally permits such motorcycles but
fines riders who commit traffic violations
higher amounts than it does other motorists.

As part of an international effort to address
environmental problems resulting from agricultural
overproduction, hundreds of thousands of acres of
surplus farmland throughout Europe will be taken out
of production in coming years. Restoring a natural
balance of flora to this land will be difficult, however,
because the nutrients in soil that has been in constant
agricultural use are depleted. Moreover, much of this
land has been heavily fertilized, and when such land
is left unplanted, problem weeds like thistles often
proliferate, preventing many native plants from
establishing themselves. While the quickest way to
restore heavily fertilized land is to remove and replace
the topsoil, this is impractical on a large scale such as
that of the European effort. And while it is generally
believed that damaged ecological systems will restore
themselves very gradually over time, a study underway
in the Netherlands is investigating the possibility of
artificially accelerating the processes through which
nature slowly reestablishes plant diversity on
previously farmed land.
In the study, a former cornfield was raked to get
rid of cornstalks and weeds, then divided into 20 plots
of roughly equal size. Control plots were replanted
with corn or sown with nothing at all. The remaining
plots were divided into two groups: plots in one group
were sown with a mixture of native grasses and herbs;
those in the other group received the same mixture of
grasses and herbs together with clover and toadflax.
After three years, thistles have been forced out of the
plots where the broadest variety of species was sown and
have also disappeared from mats of grass in the plots
sown with fewer seed varieties. On the control plots
that were left untouched, thistles have become dominant.
On some of the plots sown with seeds of native
plant species, soil from nearby land that had been
taken out of production 20 years earlier was scattered
to see what effect introducing nematodes, fungi, and
other beneficial microorganisms associated with later
stages of natural soil development might have on the
process of native plant repopulation. The seeds sown
on these enriched plots have fared better than seeds
sown on the unenriched plots, but still not as well as
those growing naturally on the nearby land. Researchers
have concluded that this is because fields farmed for
many years are overrun with aggressive disease
organisms, while, for example, beneficial mycorrhiza—
fungi that live symbiotically on plant roots and
strengthen them against the effects of disease
organisms—are lacking. These preliminary results
suggest that restoring natural plant diversity to
overfarmed land hinges on restoring a natural balance
of microorganisms in the soil. In other words, diversity
underground fosters diversity aboveground. Researchers
now believe that both kinds of diversity can be
restored more quickly to damaged land if beneficial
microorganisms are “sown” systematically into the
soil along with a wide variety of native plant seeds.

20. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the central idea of the passage?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The rehabilitation of land damaged by
agricultural overproduction can be accelerated
by means of a two-pronged strategy aimed at
restoring biological diversity.
Restoring plant diversity to overused farmland
requires many years and considerable effort.
The damaging effects of long-term agricultural
overproduction argue for the modification of
current agricultural practices.
Soil on farmland damaged by overproduction
will gradually replenish and restore itself over
time if left untouched.
Agricultural overproduction tends to encourage
the proliferation of disease organisms in the
soil as well as problem weeds.

21. Which one of the following most accurately describes
the organization of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A study is described, the results of the study are
scrutinized, and the results are judged to be
inconclusive but promising.
A hypothesis is presented, evidence both
supporting and undermining the hypothesis is
given, and a modification of the hypothesis is
argued for.
A study is evaluated, a plan of action based on
the study’s findings is suggested, and
conclusions are drawn concerning the likely
effectiveness of the plan.
A goal is stated, studies are discussed that argue
for modifying the goal’s objectives, and a
methodology is detailed to achieve the
revised goal.
A problem is presented, a study addressing the
problem is described, and a course of action
based on the study’s findings is given.

22. The passage offers which one of the following as an
explanation for why native plant varieties grew better
when sown on land that had been out of production for
20 years than when sown on the plots enriched with soil
taken from that land?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Land that has been farmed for many years lacks
certain key nutrients.
Land that has been farmed for many years is
usually overrun with harmful and aggressive
organisms.
Land that has been farmed for many years has
usually been subjected to overfertilization.
The soil that was taken from the land that had
been out of production was lacking in fungi
and other beneficial organisms.
The soil that was taken from the land that had
been out of production contained harmful
organisms that attack plant roots.

most likely to be true of any soil used to replace topsoil
in the process mentioned in the first paragraph?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Thistles cannot grow in it.
It does not contain significant amounts of fungi.
It contains very few seeds of native grasses

26. It can be inferred from the passage that if the disease
organisms mentioned in lines 46–47 were eliminated in
a plot of land that had been in constant agricultural use,
which one of the following would be the most likely
to occur?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

(A)

(B)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The field’s natural nutrients have been depleted
through overproduction.
The field’s topsoil can easily be removed
and replaced.
The field has been heavily fertilized for
many decades.
The field has the potential to support
commercial grass plants such as rye.
The field is adjacent to other fields where
corn is growing and will continue to be grown.

Populations of symbiotic mycorrhiza that live
in the soil would initially decline.
Unwanted plant species like thistles would be
unable to survive.
The chance of survival of a beneficial native
plant would increase.
The number of all types of beneficial
microorganisms would increase in the long
term.
Populations of other types of disease organisms
would increase proportionally.

27. Which one of the following is most analogous to the
process, described in the last paragraph, by which the
spread of thistles can be curtailed?

SECTION IV

Time—35 minutes
26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. When a forest is subject to acid rain, the calcium level
in the soil declines. Spruce, fir, and sugar maple trees all
need calcium to survive. However, sugar maples in
forests that receive significant acid rain are much more
likely to show signs of decline consistent with calcium
deficiency than are spruces or firs in such forests.

2. Syndicated political columnists often use their newspaper
columns to try to persuade readers to vote a certain way.
However, their efforts to persuade voters rarely succeed,
for by the time such a column appears, nearly all who
will vote in the election will have already made a
decision about which candidate to vote for.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the greater decline among sugar maples?

Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Soil in which calcium levels are significantly
diminished by acid rain is also likely to be
damaged in other ways by acid rain.
Sugar maples that do not receive enough
calcium deteriorate less rapidly than spruces
or firs that do not receive enough calcium.
Spruces and firs, unlike sugar maples, can
extract calcium from a mineral compound
that is common in soil and is not affected by
acid rain.
Sugar maples require more calcium in the
spring and summer than they do in the fall
and winter.
Unlike spruces or firs, most sugar maples are
native to areas that receive a lot of acid rain.

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Syndicated columnists influence the votes of
most of their readers who have not yet decided
which candidate to vote for.
The attempts of syndicated political columnists
to persuade readers to vote a certain way in
an election can instead cause them to vote a
different way.
People who regularly read columns by
syndicated political columnists mainly read
those written by columnists with whom they
already largely agree.
Regular readers of columns by syndicated
political columnists are less likely to be
persuaded to vote a certain way by such
columns than are people who seldom read
such columns.
People rarely can be persuaded to change their
minds about which candidate to vote for once
they have made a decision.

3. Travel industry consultant: Several airlines are
increasing elbow room and leg room in business
class, because surveys show that business travelers
value additional space more than, say, better
meals. But airlines are overconcerned about the
comfort of passengers flying on business; they
should instead focus on the comfort of leisure
travelers, because those travelers purchase
80 percent of all airline tickets.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
reasoning in the travel industry consultant’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Business travelers often make travel decisions
based on whether they feel a given airline
values their business.
Some airlines have indicated that they will
undertake alterations in seating space
throughout the entire passenger area of their
planes in the near future.
Sleeping in comfort during long flights is not
the primary concern of leisure travelers.
A far greater proportion of an airline’s revenues
is derived from business travelers than from
leisure travelers.
Most leisure travelers buy airline tickets only
when fares are discounted.

4. Gaby: In school, children should be allowed fully to
follow their own interests, supported by
experienced teachers who offer minimal guidance.
This enables them to be most successful in their
adult lives.
Logan: I disagree. Schoolchildren should acquire the
fundamental knowledge necessary for future
success, and they learn such fundamentals only
through disciplined, systematic instruction from
accredited teachers.
Gaby’s and Logan’s comments provide most support for
the claim that they disagree about
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the way in which schoolchildren best acquire
fundamental knowledge
the extent to which teachers should direct
schoolchildren’s education
the importance of having qualified teachers
involved in schoolchildren’s education
the sort of school environment that most fosters
children’s creativity
the extent to which schoolchildren are interested
in fundamental academic subjects

5. Judge: The case before me involves a plaintiff and three
codefendants. The plaintiff has applied to the
court for an order permitting her to question each
defendant without their codefendants or their
codefendants’ legal counsel being present. Two of
the codefendants, however, share the same legal
counsel. The court will not order any codefendant
to find new legal counsel. Therefore, the order
requested by the plaintiff cannot be granted.
The conclusion of the judge’s argument is most strongly
supported if which one of the following principles is
assumed to hold?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

A court cannot issue an order that forces legal
counsel to disclose information revealed by
a client.
Defendants have the right to have their legal
counsel present when being questioned.
People being questioned in legal proceedings
may refuse to answer questions that are
self-incriminating.
A plaintiff in a legal case should never be
granted a right that is denied to a defendant.
A defendant’s legal counsel has the right to
question the plaintiff.

6. The calm, shallow waters of coastal estuaries are easily
polluted by nutrient-rich sewage. When estuary waters
become overnutrified as a result, algae proliferate. The
abundant algae, in turn, sometimes provide a rich food
source for microorganisms that are toxic to fish, thereby
killing most of the fish in the estuary.
Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the information above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Fish in an estuary that has been polluted by
sewage are generally more likely to die from
pollution than are fish in an estuary that has
been polluted in some other way.
In estuary waters that contain abundant algae,
microorganisms that are toxic to fish reproduce
more quickly than other types of microorganisms.
Nutrients and other components of sewage do
not harm fish in coastal estuaries in any way
other than through the resulting proliferation of
toxic microorganisms.
Algae will not proliferate in coastal estuaries
that are not polluted by nutrient-rich sewage.
Overnutrifying estuary waters by sewage can
result in the death of most of the fish in the
estuary.

7. The ruins of the prehistoric Bolivian city of Tiwanaku
feature green andacite stones weighing up to 40 tons.
These stones were quarried at Copacabana, which is
across a lake and about 90 kilometers away.
Archaeologists hypothesize that the stones were brought
to Tiwanaku on reed boats. To show this was possible,
experimenters transported a 9-ton stone from Copacabana
to Tiwanaku using a reed boat built with locally
available materials and techniques traditional to the area.
Which one of the following would be most useful to
know in order to evaluate the support for the
archaeologists’ hypothesis?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

whether the traditional techniques for building
reed boats were in use at the time Tiwanaku
was inhabited
whether green andacite stones quarried at the
time Tiwanaku was inhabited were used at
any sites near Copacabana
whether reed boats are commonly used today
on the lake
whether the green andacite stones at Tiwanaku
are the largest stones at the site
whether the reed boat built for the experimenters
is durable enough to remain usable for several
years

8. Union member: Some members of our labor union are
calling for an immediate strike. But a strike would
cut into our strike fund and would in addition lead
to a steep fine, causing us to suffer a major
financial loss. Therefore, we must not strike now.
The union member’s argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that it
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

fails to consider that a strike might cause the
union to suffer a financial loss even if no fine
were imposed
fails to define adequately what constitutes a
major financial loss
fails to consider that the benefits to be gained
from a strike might outweigh the costs
takes for granted that the most important factor
in the labor union’s bargaining position is the
union’s financial strength
fails to establish that there will be a better
opportunity to strike at a later time

9. Birds and mammals can be infected with West Nile virus
only through mosquito bites. Mosquitoes, in turn,
become infected with the virus when they bite certain
infected birds or mammals. The virus was originally
detected in northern Africa and spread to North America
in the 1990s. Humans sometimes catch West Nile virus,
but the virus never becomes abundant enough in human
blood to infect a mosquito.
The statements above, if true, most strongly support
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

West Nile virus will never be a common disease
among humans.
West Nile virus is most common in those parts
of North America with the highest density of
mosquitoes.
Some people who become infected with
West Nile virus never show symptoms of
illness.
West Nile virus infects more people in
northern Africa than it does in North America.
West Nile virus was not carried to North America
via an infected person.

10. In trying to reduce the amount of fat in their diet, on
average people have decreased their consumption of
red meat by one-half in the last two decades. However,
on average those who have reduced their consumption
of red meat actually consume substantially more fat than
those who have not.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Many more people have reduced their
consumption of red meat over the last two
decades than have not.
Higher prices over the last two decades have
done as much to decrease the consumption of
red meat as health concerns have.
People who reduce their consumption of red
meat tend to consume as much of other foods
that are high in fat as do those who have not
reduced their consumption of red meat.
People who reduce their consumption of red
meat tend to replace it with cheese and baked
goods, which are richer in fat than red meat.
Studies have shown that red meat contains
slightly less fat than previously thought.

11. Rolanda: The house on Oak Avenue has a larger yard
than any other house we’ve looked at in
Prairieview, so that’s the best one to rent.

Tom: No, it isn’t. Its yard isn’t really as big as it looks.
Property lines in Prairieview actually start 20 feet
from the street. So what looks like part of the
yard is really city property.
Rolanda: But that’s true of all the other properties we’ve
looked at too!
Rolanda’s response to Tom suggests that Tom commits
which one of the following reasoning errors?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

He fails to take into account the possibility that
there are advantages to having a small yard.
He presumes, without providing justification,
that property that belongs to the city is
available for private use.
He improperly applies a generalization to an
instance that it was not intended to cover.
He fails to apply a general rule to all relevant
instances.
He presumes, without providing justification,
that whatever is true of a part of a thing is also
true of the whole.

12. The best jazz singers use their voices much as horn
players use their instruments. The great Billie Holiday
thought of her singing voice as a horn, reshaping
melody and words to increase their impact. Conversely,
jazz horn players achieve their distinctive sounds by
emulating the spontaneous twists and turns of an
impassioned voice. So jazz consists largely of voicelike
horns and hornlike voices.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the argument by the claim that the
best jazz singers use their voices much as horn players
use their instruments?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is the argument’s main conclusion and is
supported by another statement, which is itself
supported by a further statement.
It is the argument’s only conclusion, and each
of the other statements in the argument is used
to support it.
It is a statement for which some evidence is
provided and which in turn is used to provide
support for the argument’s main conclusion.
It is a statement for which no evidence is
provided but which itself is used to support the
argument’s only conclusion.
It is a statement used to support a conclusion
that in turn is used to support the argument’s

13. Educator: Reducing class sizes in our school district
would require hiring more teachers. However,
there is already a shortage of qualified teachers
in the region. Although students receive more
individualized instruction when classes are
smaller, education suffers when teachers are
underqualified. Therefore, reducing class sizes in
our district would probably not improve overall
student achievement.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the educator’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Class sizes in the school district should be
reduced only if doing so would improve
overall student achievement.
At least some qualified teachers in the school
district would be able to improve the overall
achievement of students in their classes if
class sizes were reduced.
Students place a greater value on having qualified
teachers than on having smaller classes.
Hiring more teachers would not improve the
achievement of any students in the school
district if most or all of the teachers hired
were underqualified.
Qualified teachers could not be persuaded to
relocate in significant numbers to the
educator’s region to take teaching jobs.

14. Geographer: Because tropical storms require heat and
moisture, they form especially over ocean surfaces
of at least 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees
Fahrenheit), ocean temperatures that global
warming would encourage. For this reason,
many early discussions of global warming
predicted that it would cause more frequent and
intense tropical storms. But recent research shows
that this prediction is unlikely to be borne out.
Other factors, such as instabilities in wind flow,
are likely to counteract global warming’s effects
on tropical storm development.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn in the geographer’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Tropical storms are especially likely to form
over warm ocean surfaces.
Contrary to early discussions, global warming is
not the only factor affecting the frequency and
intensity of tropical storms.
If global warming were reversed, tropical storms
would be less frequent and less intense.
Instabilities in wind flow will negate the effect
of global warming on the formation of
tropical storms.
Global warming probably will not produce
more frequent and intense tropical storms.

15. Copyright was originally the grant of a temporary
government-supported monopoly on copying a work.
Its sole purpose was to encourage the circulation of
ideas by giving authors the opportunity to derive a
reasonable financial reward from their works. However,
copyright sometimes goes beyond its original purpose
since sometimes _______.
The conclusion of the argument is most strongly
supported if which one of the following completes
the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

publication of copyrighted works is not the only
way to circulate ideas
authors are willing to circulate their works even
without any financial reward
authors are unable to find a publisher for their
copyrighted work
there is no practical way to enforce copyrights
copyrights hold for many years after an
author’s death

16. Critic to economist: In yet another of your bumbling
forecasts, last year you predicted that this country’s
economy would soon go into recession if current
economic policies were not changed. Instead,
economic growth is even stronger this year.
Economist: There was nothing at all bumbling about
my warning. Indeed, it convinced the country’s
leaders to change economic policies, which is
what prevented a recession.

17. Watching music videos from the 1970s would give the
viewer the impression that the music of the time was
dominated by synthesizer pop and punk rock. But this
would be a misleading impression. Because music videos

cutting-edge musicians.

in its reasoning to that of the argument above?
(A)

(B)

future readers.
Our memory of 1960s TV shows could hardly
be improved, because so many of the television

since it is primarily publishers interested in
computer games that are using CD-ROM.
Our understanding of silent films is incomplete,
because few filmmakers of the time realized

18. Hospitals, universities, labor unions, and other
institutions may well have public purposes and be quite

Which one of the following generalizations is most
clearly illustrated by the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

What is true of some social organizations is not
necessarily true of all such organizations.
An organization can have a property that not all
of its members possess.
People often claim altruistic motives for actions
that are in fact selfish.
Many social institutions have social consequences
unintended by those who founded them.
Often an instrument created for one purpose
will be found to serve another purpose just
as effectively.

19. Consumer advocate: In some countries, certain produce
is routinely irradiated with gamma rays in order
to extend shelf life. There are, however, good
reasons to avoid irradiated foods. First, they are
exposed to the radioactive substances that
produce the gamma rays. Second, irradiation can
reduce the vitamin content of fresh foods, leaving
behind harmful chemical residues. Third,
irradiation spawns unique radiolytic products that
cause serious health problems, including cancer.

21. Philosopher: To explain the causes of cultural phenomena,
a social scientist needs data about several societies:
one cannot be sure, for example, that a given
political structure is brought about only by certain
ecological or climatic factors unless one knows
that there are no similarly structured societies not
subject to those factors, and no societies that, though
subject to those factors, are not so structured.

Each of the following, if true, weakens the consumer
advocate’s argument EXCEPT:

The claim that to explain the causes of cultural
phenomena, a social scientist needs data about several
societies plays which one of the following roles in the
philosopher’s reasoning?

(A)

Unique radiolytic products have seldom been
found in any irradiated food.
Cancer and other serious health problems have
many causes that are unrelated to radioactive
substances and gamma rays.
A study showed that irradiation leaves the
vitamin content of virtually all fruits and
vegetables unchanged.
The amount of harmful chemicals found in
irradiated foods is less than the amount that
occurs naturally in most kinds of foods.
A study showed that the cancer rate is no higher
among people who eat irradiated food than
among those who do not.

20. When teaching art students about the use of color,
teachers should use colored paper rather than paint in
their demonstrations. Colored paper is preferable
because it readily permits a repeated use of exactly the
same color in different compositions, which allows for a
precise comparison of that color’s impact in varying
contexts. With paint, however, it is difficult to mix
exactly the same color twice, and the varying textures
of the applied paint can interfere with the pure effect
of the color itself.

(E)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Two pieces of paper of exactly the same color
will have the same effect in a given context,
even if they are of different textures.
A slight difference in the color of two pieces of
paper is more difficult to notice than a similar
difference in the color of two samples of paint.
Changing light conditions have less of an effect
on the apparent color of a piece of paper than
on the apparent color of a sample of paint.
Observing the impacts of colors across varying
contexts helps students to learn about the use
of color.
It is important that art students understand how
the effects of using colored paper in various
compositions differ from those of using paint
in those compositions.

It describes a problem that the philosopher
claims is caused by the social scientist’s need
for certainty.
It is a premise used to support a general
theoretical claim about the nature of cause
and effect relationships.
It is a general hypothesis that is illustrated with
an example showing that there is a causal
relationship between political structures and
environmental conditions.
It is a dilemma that, it is argued, is faced by
every social scientist because of the difficulty
of determining whether a given cultural
phenomenon is the cause or the effect of a
given factor.
It is a claim that the philosopher attempts to
justify by appeal to the requirements for
establishing the existence of one kind of
causal relationship.

22. Scientist: Physicists claim that their system of careful
peer review prevents scientific fraud in physics
effectively. But biologists claimed the same thing
for their field 20 years ago, and they turned out to
be wrong. Since then, biologists have greatly
enhanced their discipline’s safeguards against
scientific fraud, thus preventing further major
incidents. It would be conducive to progress in
physics if physicists were to do the same thing.
The conclusion of the scientist’s argument is most strongly
supported if which one of the following is assumed?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Major incidents of scientific fraud in a scientific
discipline are deleterious to progress in that
discipline.
Very few incidents of even minor scientific fraud
have occurred in biology over the last 20 years.
No system of careful peer review is completely
effective in preventing scientific fraud in any
scientific discipline.
Twenty years ago the system of peer review in
biology was less effective in preventing
scientific fraud than the system of peer review
in physics is today.
Over the years, there have been relatively few, if
any, major incidents of scientific fraud in physics.

23. Biologist: Researchers believe that dogs are the
descendants of domesticated wolves that were
bred to be better companions for humans. It has
recently been found that some breeds of dog are
much more closely related genetically to wolves
than to most other breeds of dog. This shows that
some dogs are descended from wolves that were
domesticated much more recently than others.

24. Paleomycologists, scientists who study ancient forms
of fungi, are invariably acquainted with the scholarly
publications of all other paleomycologists.
Professor Mansour is acquainted with the scholarly
publications of Professor DeAngelis, who is a
paleomycologist. Therefore, Professor Mansour must
also be a paleomycologist.

Which one of the following principles underlies the
biologist’s argument?

The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above
is most similar to that in which one of the following
arguments?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If one breed of dog is descended from wolves
that were domesticated more recently than
were the wolves from which most other breeds
of dog are descended, the former breed may
be more closely related to wolves than those
other breeds are.
If one breed of dog is more closely related to
wolves than to another breed of dog, then the
former breed of dog has more recent
undomesticated wolf ancestors than the latter
breed has.
Any breed of dog descended from wolves that
were domesticated is more closely related
genetically to at least some other breeds of
dog than to wolves.
If one breed of dog is more closely related to
wolves than another breed of dog is, then the
former breed of dog is more closely related to
wolves than to the latter breed of dog.
Any two breeds of dog that are more closely
related to each other than to wolves are both
descended from wolves that were domesticated
long ago.

When a flight on Global Airlines is delayed,
all connecting Global Airlines flights are also
delayed so that the passengers can make their
connections. Since Frieda’s connecting flight
on Global was delayed, her first flight must
have also been a delayed Global Airlines flight.
Any time that one of Global Airlines’ local
ticket agents misses a shift, the other agents
on that shift need to work harder than usual.
Since none of Global’s local ticket agents
missed a shift last week, the airline’s local
ticket agents did not have to work harder than
usual last week.
Any time the price of fuel decreases, Global
Airlines’ expenses decrease and its income is
unaffected. The price of fuel decreased several
times last year. Therefore, Global Airlines
must have made a profit last year.
All employees of Global Airlines can participate
in its retirement plan after they have been with
the company a year or more. Gavin has been
with Global Airlines for three years. We can
therefore be sure that he participates in
Global’s retirement plan.
Whenever a competitor of Global Airlines
reduces its fares, Global must follow suit or
lose passengers. Global carried more passengers
last year than it did the year before. Therefore,
Global must have reduced its fares last year to
match reductions in its competitors’ fares.

25. Lutsina: Because futuristic science fiction does not need
to represent current social realities, its writers can
envisage radically new social arrangements. Thus
it has the potential to be a richer source of social
criticism than is conventional fiction.
Priscilla: That futuristic science fiction writers more
skillfully envisage radically new technologies
than new social arrangements shows how writers’
imaginations are constrained by current realities.
Because of this limitation, the most effective
social criticism results from faithfully presenting
the current social realities for critical examination,
as happens in conventional fiction.
Lutsina and Priscilla disagree with each other about
whether
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

some science fiction writers have succeeded in
envisaging convincing, radically new social
arrangements
writers of conventional fiction are more skillful
than are writers of futuristic science fiction
futuristic science fiction has more promise as
a source of social criticism than does
conventional fiction
envisaging radically new technologies rather
than radically new social arrangements is a
shortcoming of futuristic science fiction
criticism of current social arrangements is not
effective when those arrangements are
contrasted with radically different ones

26. Because our club recruited the best volleyball players in
the city, we will have the best team in the city. Moreover,
since the best team in the city will be the team most
likely to win the city championship, our club will
almost certainly be city champions this year.
The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the
argument
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

presumes, without presenting relevant evidence,
that an entity can be distinguished as the best
only on the basis of competition
predicts the success of an entity on the basis of
features that are not relevant to the quality of
that entity
predicts the outcome of a competition merely on
the basis of a comparison between the parties in
that competition
presumes, without providing warrant, that if an
entity is the best among its competitors, then
each individual part of that entity must also
be the best
concludes that because an event is the most
likely of a set of possible events, that event is
more likely to occur than not
