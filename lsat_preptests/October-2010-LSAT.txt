The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR), approved by the United Nations General
Assembly in 1948, was the first international treaty to
expressly affirm universal respect for human rights.
Prior to 1948 no truly international standard of
humanitarian beliefs existed. Although Article 1 of
the 1945 UN Charter had been written with the
express purpose of obligating the UN to “encourage
respect for human rights and for fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,
language, or religion,” there were members of
delegations from various small countries and
representatives of several nongovernmental
organizations who felt that the language of Article 1
was not strong enough, and that the Charter as a
whole did not go far enough in its efforts to
guarantee basic human rights. This group lobbied
vigorously to strengthen the Charter’s human rights
provisions and proposed that member states be
required “to take separate and joint action and to
co-operate with the organization for the promotion of
human rights.” This would have implied an obligation
for member states to act on human rights issues.
Ultimately, this proposal and others like it were not
adopted; instead, the UDHR was commissioned and
drafted.
The original mandate for producing the document
was given to the UN Commission on Human Rights
in February 1946. Between that time and the General
Assembly’s final approval of the document, the
UDHR passed through an elaborate eight-stage
drafting process in which it made its way through
almost every level of the UN hierarchy. The articles
were debated at each stage, and all 30 articles were
argued passionately by delegates representing diverse
ideologies, traditions, and cultures. The document as
it was finally approved set forth the essential
principles of freedom and equality for everyone—
regardless of sex, race, color, language, religion,
political or other opinion, national or social origin,
property, birth or other status. It also asserted a
number of fundamental human rights, including
among others the right to work, the right to rest and
leisure, and the right to education.
While the UDHR is in many ways a progressive
document, it also has weaknesses, the most
regrettable of which is its nonbinding legal status. For
all its strong language and high ideals, the UDHR
remains a resolution of a purely programmatic nature.
Nevertheless, the document has led, even if belatedly,
to the creation of legally binding human rights

(55)

conventions, and it clearly deserves recognition as an
international standard-setting piece of work, as a set
of aspirations to which UN member states are
intended to strive, and as a call to arms in the name
of humanity, justice, and freedom.

1. By referring to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights as “purely programmatic” (line 49) in nature,
the author most likely intends to emphasize
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

the likelihood that the document will inspire
innovative government programs designed to
safeguard human rights
the ability of the document’s drafters to translate
abstract ideals into concrete standards
the compromises that went into producing a
version of the document that would garner the
approval of all relevant parties
the fact that the guidelines established by the
document are ultimately unenforceable
the frustration experienced by the document’s
drafters at stubborn resistance from within the
UN hierarchy

UN Charter (lines 8–11) and the proposal mentioned in
lines 20–22 for which one of the following reasons?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

to contrast the different definitions of human
rights in the two documents
to compare the strength of the human rights
language in the two documents
to identify a bureaucratic vocabulary that is
common to the two documents
to highlight what the author believes to be the
most important point in each document

of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It asserts a right to rest and leisure.
It was drafted after the UN Charter was drafted.
The UN Commission on Human Rights was
charged with producing it.
It has had no practical consequences.
It was the first international treaty to explicitly
affirm universal respect for human rights.

5. The author would be most likely to agree with which
one of the following statements?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The human rights language contained in
Article 1 of the UN Charter is so ambiguous
as to be almost wholly ineffectual.
The weaknesses of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights generally outweigh the strengths
of the document.
It was relatively easy for the drafters of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights to
reach a consensus concerning the contents of
the document.
The drafters of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights omitted important rights that
should be included in a truly comprehensive
list of basic human rights.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
would be truer to the intentions of its
staunchest proponents if UN member countries
were required by law to abide by its
provisions.

6. Suppose that a group of independent journalists has
uncovered evidence of human rights abuses being
perpetrated by a security agency of a UN member state

be advocated by present-day delegates who share the
views of the delegates and representatives mentioned in
lines 11–14?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The UN General Assembly authenticates the
evidence and then insists upon prompt remedial
action on the part of the government of the
member state.

proposed response must be unanimously
accepted by member states before it can be
implemented.
The UN issues a report critical of the actions of
the member state in question and calls for a
censure vote in the General Assembly.
The situation is regarded by the UN as an
internal matter that is best left to the discretion
of the government of the member state.
The situation is investigated further by
nongovernmental humanitarian organizations
that promise to disclose their findings to the
public via the international media.

It is commonly assumed that even if some
forgeries have aesthetic merit, no forgery has as much
as an original by the imitated artist would. Yet even
the most prominent art specialists can be duped by a
talented artist turned forger into mistaking an almost
perfect forgery for an original. For instance, artist
Han van Meegeren’s The Disciples at Emmaus
(1937)—painted under the forged signature of the
acclaimed Dutch master Jan Vermeer (1632–1675)—
attracted lavish praise from experts as one of
Vermeer’s finest works. The painting hung in a
Rotterdam museum until 1945, when, to the great
embarrassment of the critics, van Meegeren revealed
its origin. Astonishingly, there was at least one highly
reputed critic who persisted in believing it to be a
Vermeer even after van Meegeren’s confession.
Given the experts’ initial enthusiasm, some
philosophers argue that van Meegeren’s painting must
have possessed aesthetic characteristics that, in a
Vermeer original, would have justified the critics’
plaudits. Van Meegeren’s Emmaus thus raises difficult
questions regarding the status of superbly executed
forgeries. Is a forgery inherently inferior as art? How
are we justified, if indeed we are, in revising
downwards our critical assessment of a work
unmasked as a forgery? Philosopher of art Alfred
Lessing proposes convincing answers to these
questions.
A forged work is indeed inferior as art, Lessing
argues, but not because of a shortfall in aesthetic
qualities strictly defined, that is to say, in the qualities
perceptible on the picture’s surface. For example, in
its composition, its technique, and its brilliant use of
color, van Meegeren’s work is flawless, even
beautiful. Lessing argues instead that the deficiency
lies in what might be called the painting’s intangible
qualities. All art, explains Lessing, involves
technique, but not all art involves origination of a
new vision, and originality of vision is one of the
fundamental qualities by which artistic, as opposed to
purely aesthetic, accomplishment is measured. Thus
Vermeer is acclaimed for having inaugurated, in the
seventeenth century, a new way of seeing, and for
pioneering techniques for embodying this new way of
seeing through distinctive treatment of light, color,
and form.
Even if we grant that van Meegeren, with his
undoubted mastery of Vermeer’s innovative
techniques, produced an aesthetically superior
painting, he did so about three centuries after
Vermeer developed the techniques in question.
Whereas Vermeer’s origination of these techniques in
the seventeenth century represents a truly impressive
and historic achievement, van Meegeren’s production
of The Disciples at Emmaus in the twentieth century
presents nothing new or creative to the history of art.
Van Meegeren’s forgery therefore, for all its aesthetic
merits, lacks the historical significance that makes
Vermeer’s work artistically great.

7. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The Disciples at Emmaus, van Meegeren’s
forgery of a Vermeer, was a failure in both
aesthetic and artistic terms.
The aesthetic value of a work of art is less
dependent on the work’s visible characteristics
than on certain intangible characteristics.
Forged artworks are artistically inferior to
originals because artistic value depends in large
part on originality of vision.
The most skilled forgers can deceive even highly
qualified art experts into accepting their work
as original.
Art critics tend to be unreliable judges of the
aesthetic and artistic quality of works of art.

8. The passage provides the strongest support for inferring
that Lessing holds which one of the following views?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The judgments of critics who pronounced The
Disciples at Emmaus to be aesthetically superb
were not invalidated by the revelation that the
painting is a forgery.
The financial value of a work of art depends
more on its purely aesthetic qualities than
on its originality.
Museum curators would be better off not taking
art critics’ opinions into account when
attempting to determine whether a work of art
is authentic.
Because it is such a skilled imitation of
Vermeer, The Disciples at Emmaus is as
artistically successful as are original paintings
by artists who are less significant than
Vermeer.
Works of art that have little or no aesthetic
value can still be said to be great achievements
in artistic terms.

9. In the first paragraph, the author refers to a highly
reputed critic’s persistence in believing van Meegeren’s
forgery to be a genuine Vermeer primarily in order to
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

argue that many art critics are inflexible in their
judgments
indicate that the critics who initially praised The
Disciples at Emmaus were not as
knowledgeable as they appeared
suggest that the painting may yet turn out to be
a genuine Vermeer
emphasize that the concept of forgery itself is
internally incoherent
illustrate the difficulties that skillfully executed
forgeries can pose for art critics

10. The reaction described in which one of the following
scenarios is most analogous to the reaction of the art
critics mentioned in line 13?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

lovers of a musical group contemptuously reject
a tribute album recorded by various other
musicians as a second-rate imitation
art historians extol the work of a little-known
painter as innovative until it is discovered that
the painter lived much more recently than was
originally thought
diners at a famous restaurant effusively praise
the food as delicious until they learn that the
master chef is away for the night
literary critics enthusiastically applaud a new
novel until its author reveals that its central
symbols are intended to represent political
views that the critics dislike
movie fans evaluate a particular movie more
favorably than they otherwise might have
because their favorite actor plays the lead role

11. The passage provides the strongest support for inferring
that Lessing holds which one of the following views?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is probable that many paintings currently
hanging in important museums are actually
forgeries.
The historical circumstances surrounding the
creation of a work are important in assessing
the artistic value of that work.
The greatness of an innovative artist depends on
how much influence he or she has on other
artists.
The standards according to which a work is
judged to be a forgery tend to vary from one
historical period to another.
An artist who makes use of techniques
developed by others cannot be said to be
innovative.

-13-

12. The passage most strongly supports which one of the
following statements?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

In any historical period, the criteria by which a
work is classified as a forgery can be a matter
of considerable debate.
An artist who uses techniques that others have
developed is most likely a forger.
A successful forger must originate a new artistic
vision.
Works of art created early in the career of a
great artist are more likely than those created
later to embody historic innovations.
A painting can be a forgery even if it is not a
copy of a particular original work of art.

13. Which one of the following, if true, would most
strengthen Lessing’s contention that a painting can
display aesthetic excellence without possessing an
equally high degree of artistic value?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Many of the most accomplished art forgers have
had moderately successful careers as painters
of original works.
Reproductions painted by talented young artists
whose traditional training consisted in the
copying of masterpieces were often seen as
beautiful, but never regarded as great art.
While experts can detect most forgeries, they
can be duped by a talented forger who knows
exactly what characteristics experts expect to
find in the work of a particular painter.
Most attempts at art forgery are ultimately
unsuccessful because the forger has not
mastered the necessary techniques.
The criteria by which aesthetic excellence is
judged change significantly from one century
to another and from one culture to another.

Passage A
One function of language is to influence others’
behavior by changing what they know, believe, or
desire. For humans engaged in conversation, the
perception of another’s mental state is perhaps the
most common vocalization stimulus.
While animal vocalizations may have evolved
because they can potentially alter listeners’ behavior to
the signaler’s benefit, such communication is—in
contrast to human language—inadvertent, because
most animals, with the possible exception of chimpanzees,
cannot attribute mental states to others. The male
Physalaemus frog calls because calling causes females
to approach and other males to retreat, but there is no
evidence that he does so because he attributes knowledge
or desire to other frogs, or because he knows his calls
will affect their knowledge and that this knowledge
will, in turn, affect their behavior. Research also suggests
that, in marked contrast to humans, nonhuman primates
do not produce vocalizations in response to perception
of another’s need for information. Macaques, for example,
give alarm calls when predators approach and coo calls
upon finding food, yet experiments reveal no evidence
that individuals were more likely to call about these
events when they were aware of them but their offspring
were clearly ignorant; similarly, chimpanzees do not
appear to adjust their calling to inform ignorant
individuals of their own location or that of food. Many
animal vocalizations whose production initially seems
goal-directed are not as purposeful as they first appear.
Passage B
Many scientists distinguish animal communication
systems from human language on the grounds that the
former are rigid responses to stimuli, whereas human
language is spontaneous and creative.
In this connection, it is commonly stated that no
animal can use its communication system to lie.
Obviously, a lie requires intention to deceive: to judge
whether a particular instance of animal communication
is truly prevarication requires knowledge of the animal’s
intentions. Language philosopher H. P. Grice explains
that for an individual to mean something by uttering x,
the individual must intend, in expressing x, to induce
an audience to believe something and must also intend
the utterance to be recognized as so intended. But
conscious intention is a category of mental experience
widely believed to be uniquely human. Philosopher
Jacques Maritain’s discussion of the honeybee’s
elaborate “waggle-dance” exemplifies this view.
Although bees returning to the hive communicate to
other bees the distance and direction of food sources,
such communication is, Maritain asserts, merely a
conditioned reflex: animals may use communicative
signs but lack conscious intention regarding their use.
But these arguments are circular: conscious
intention is ruled out a priori and then its absence
taken as evidence that animal communication is
fundamentally different from human language. In fact,
the narrowing of the perceived gap between animal

(60)

(65)

communication and human language revealed by
recent research with chimpanzees and other animals
calls into question not only the assumption that the
difference between animal and human communication
is qualitative rather than merely quantitative, but also
the accompanying assumption that animals respond
mechanically to stimuli, whereas humans speak with
conscious understanding and intent.

14. Both passages are primarily concerned with addressing
which one of the following questions?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Are animals capable of deliberately
prevaricating in order to achieve specific
goals?
Are the communications of animals
characterized by conscious intention?
What kinds of stimuli are most likely to elicit
animal vocalizations?
Are the communication systems of nonhuman
primates qualitatively different from those of
all other animals?
Is there a scientific consensus about the
differences between animal communication
systems and human language?

15. In discussing the philosopher Maritain, the author of
passage B seeks primarily to
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

describe an interpretation of animal
communication that the author believes rests
on a logical error
suggest by illustration that there is conscious
intention underlying the communicative signs
employed by certain animals
present an argument in support of the view that
animal communication systems are
spontaneous and creative

most animal communication is merely a
conditioned reflex

communication whose views the author
regards with respect

with which one of the following statements regarding
researchers who subscribe to the position articulated in
passage A?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

They fail to recognize that humans often
communicate without any clear idea of their
listeners’ mental states.
Most of them lack the credentials needed to
assess the relevant experimental evidence
correctly.
They ignore well-known evidence that animals
do in fact practice deception.
They make assumptions about matters that
should be determined empirically.
They falsely believe that all communication
systems can be explained in terms of their
evolutionary benefits.

17. Which one of the following assertions from passage A
provides support for the view attributed to Maritain in
passage B (lines 50–52)?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

One function of language is to influence the
behavior of others by changing what they
think.
Animal vocalizations may have evolved because
they have the potential to alter listeners’
behavior to the signaler’s benefit.
It is possible that chimpanzees may have the
capacity to attribute mental states to others.
There is no evidence that the male Physalaemus
frog calls because he knows that his calls will
affect the knowledge of other frogs.
Macaques give alarm calls when predators
approach and coo calls upon finding food.

the extent to which communication among
humans involves the ability to perceive the

the importance of determining to what extent
animal communication systems differ from
human language
whether human language and animal
communication differ from one another
qualitatively or merely in a matter of degree
whether chimpanzees’ vocalizations suggest that
they may possess the capacity to attribute
mental states to others
whether animals’ vocalizations evolved to alter
the behavior of other animals in a way that
benefits the signaler

-16In contrast to the mainstream of U.S.
historiography during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, African American historians of
the period, such as George Washington Williams and
W. E. B. DuBois, adopted a transnational perspective.
This was true for several reasons, not the least of
which was the necessity of doing so if certain aspects
of the history of African Americans in the United
States were to be treated honestly.
First, there was the problem of citizenship. Even
after the adoption in 1868 of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which defined
citizenship, the question of citizenship for African
Americans had not been genuinely resolved. Because
of this, emigrationist sentiment was a central issue in
black political discourse, and both issues were critical
topics for investigation. The implications for historical
scholarship and national identity were enormous. While
some black leaders insisted on their right to U.S.
citizenship, others called on black people to emigrate
and find a homeland of their own. Most African
Americans were certainly not willing to relinquish
their claims to the benefits of U.S. citizenship, but many
had reached a point of profound pessimism and had
begun to question their allegiance to the United States.
Mainstream U.S. historiography was firmly rooted
in a nationalist approach during this period; the
glorification of the nation and a focus on the
nation-state as a historical force were dominant. The
expanding spheres of influence of Europe and the
United States prompted the creation of new
genealogies of nations, new myths about the
inevitability of nations, their “temperaments,” their
destinies. African American intellectuals who
confronted the nationalist approach to historiography
were troubled by its implications. Some argued that
imperialism was a natural outgrowth of nationalism
and its view that a state’s strength is measured by the
extension of its political power over colonial territory;
the scramble for colonial empires was a distinct
aspect of nationalism in the latter part of the
nineteenth century.
Yet, for all their distrust of U.S. nationalism, most
early black historians were themselves engaged in a
sort of nation building. Deliberately or not, they
contributed to the formation of a collective identity,
reconstructing a glorious African past for the
purposes of overturning degrading representations of
blackness and establishing a firm cultural basis for a
shared identity. Thus, one might argue that black
historians’ internationalism was a manifestation of a
kind of nationalism that posits a diasporic community,
which, while lacking a sovereign territory or official
language, possesses a single culture, however
mythical, with singular historical roots. Many
members of this diaspora saw themselves as an
oppressed “nation” without a homeland, or they
imagined Africa as home. Hence, these historians
understood their task to be the writing of the history
of a people scattered by force and circumstance, a
history that began in Africa.

20. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main idea of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Historians are now recognizing that the major
challenge faced by African Americans in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
was the struggle for citizenship.
Early African American historians who
practiced a transnational approach to history
were primarily interested in advancing an
emigrationist project.
U.S. historiography in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries was characterized by
a conflict between African American
historians who viewed history from a
transnational perspective and mainstream
historians who took a nationalist perspective.
The transnational perspective of early African
American historians countered mainstream
nationalist historiography, but it was arguably
nationalist itself to the extent that it posited a
culturally unified diasporic community.
Mainstream U.S. historians in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries could
no longer justify their nationalist approach to
history once they were confronted with the
transnational perspective taken by African
American historians.

21. Which one of the following phrases most accurately
conveys the sense of the word “reconstructing” as it is
used in line 47?
(A)
(B)

(D)
(E)

correcting a misconception about
determining the sequence of events in
investigating the implications of
rewarding the promoters of
shaping a conception of

22. Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Emigrationist sentiment would not have been as
strong among African Americans in the late
nineteenth century had the promise of U.S.
citizenship been fully realized for African
Americans at that time.
Scholars writing the history of diasporic
communities generally do not discuss the
forces that initially caused the scattering of the
members of those communities.
Most historians of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries endeavored to make the
histories of the nations about which they wrote
seem more glorious than they actually were.
To be properly considered nationalist, a historical
work must ignore the ways in which one nation’s
foreign policy decisions affected other nations.
A considerable number of early African American
historians embraced nationalism and the
inevitability of the dominance of the nation-state.

23. As it is described in the passage, the transnational approach
employed by African American historians working in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would be best
exemplified by a historical study that

gain control over new territories during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
(D)
considered the impact of emigrationist sentiment
among African Americans on U.S. foreign policy
in Africa during the late nineteenth century

examined the extent to which African American
culture at the turn of the century incorporated
traditions that were common to a number of
African cultures
24. The passage provides information sufficient to answer
which one of the following questions?
(A)
Which African nations did early African
American historians research in writing their
histories of the African diaspora?

by the ancestors of the members of the African
diasporic community who were living in the
United States in the late nineteenth century?
(C)

Amendment that spurred the conflict over U.S.
citizenship for African Americans?
(E)
In what ways did African American leaders
respond to the question of citizenship for
African Americans in the latter part of the
nineteenth century?
25. The author of the passage would be most likely to
agree with which one of the following statements?
(A)
Members of a particular diasporic community
have a common country of origin.
(B)
Territorial sovereignty is not a prerequisite for
the project of nation building.
(C)
Early African American historians who rejected
nationalist historiography declined to engage in
historical myth-making of any kind.
(D)
The most prominent African American historians in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
advocated emigration for African Americans.
(E)
Historians who employed a nationalist approach
focused on entirely different events from those
studied and written about by early African
American historians.

-1726. The main purpose of the second paragraph of the
passage is to
(A)
explain why early African American historians
felt compelled to approach historiography in
the way that they did
(B)
show that governmental actions such as
constitutional amendments do not always have
the desired effect
(C)
support the contention that African American
intellectuals in the late nineteenth century were
critical of U.S. imperialism
(D)
establish that some African American political
leaders in the late nineteenth century advocated
emigration as an alternative to fighting for the
benefits of U.S. citizenship
(E)
argue that the definition of citizenship contained
in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution is too limited
27. As it is presented in the passage, the approach to
history taken by mainstream U.S. historians of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is most similar
to the approach exemplified in which one of the
following?
(A)
An elected official writes a memo suggesting
that because a particular course of action has
been successful in the past, the government
should continue to pursue that course of action.
(B)
A biographer of a famous novelist argues that

25 Questions

Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Mary to Jamal: You acknowledge that as the legitimate
owner of this business I have the legal right to sell
it whenever I wish. But also you claim that
because loyal employees will suffer if I sell it, I
therefore have no right to do so. Obviously, your
statements taken together are absurd.

2. Since there is no survival value in an animal’s having an
organ that is able to function when all its other organs
have broken down to such a degree that the animal dies,
it is a result of the efficiency of natural selection that no
organ is likely to evolve in such a way that it greatly
outlasts the body’s other organs.

Mary’s reasoning is most vulnerable to the criticism
that she

Of the following, which one illustrates a principle that is
most similar to the principle illustrated by the passage?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

overlooks the possibility that when Jamal claims
that she has no right to sell the business, he
simply means she has no right to do so at this
time
overlooks the possibility that her employees
also have rights related to the sale of the
business
provides no evidence for the claim that she does
have a right to sell the business
overlooks the possibility that Jamal is referring
to two different kinds of right
attacks Jamal’s character rather than his
argument

(B)

(D)

(E)

A store in a lower-income neighborhood finds
that it is unable to sell its higher-priced goods
and so stocks them only when ordered by a
customer.
The body of an animal with a deficient organ is
often able to compensate for that deficiency
when other organs perform the task the
deficient one normally performs.
One car model produced by an automobile
manufacturer has a life expectancy that is so
much longer than its other models that its great
popularity requires the manufacturer to stop
producing some of the other models.
Athletes occasionally overdevelop some parts of
their bodies to such a great extent that other
parts of their bodies are more prone to injury
as a result.
Automotive engineers find that it is not costeffective to manufacture a given automobile
part of such high quality that it outlasts all
other parts of the automobile, as doing so
would not raise the overall quality of the
automobile.

3. Commentator: If a political administration is both
economically successful and successful at
protecting individual liberties, then it is an overall
success. Even an administration that fails to care
for the environment may succeed overall if it
protects individual liberties. So far, the present
administration has not cared for the environment
but has successfully protected individual liberties.
If all of the statements above are true, then which one
of the following must be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

The present administration is economically
successful.
The present administration is not an overall
success.
If the present administration is economically
successful, then it is an overall success.
If the present administration had been
economically successful, it would have cared
for the environment.
If the present administration succeeds at
environmental protection, then it will be an
overall success.

4. The legislature is considering a proposed bill that would
prohibit fishing in Eagle Bay. Despite widespread
concern over the economic effect this ban would have
on the local fishing industry, the bill should be enacted.
The bay has one of the highest water pollution levels in
the nation, and a recent study of the bay’s fish found
that 80 percent of them contained toxin levels that
exceed governmental safety standards. Continuing to
permit fishing in Eagle Bay could thus have grave
effects on public health.
The argument proceeds by presenting evidence that

the toxic contamination of fish in Eagle Bay has
had grave economic effects on the local fishing
industry
the moral principle that an action must be
judged on the basis of its foreseeable effects is
usually correct
the opponents of the ban have failed to weigh
properly its foreseeable negative effects against
its positive ones
failure to enact the ban would carry with it
unacceptable risks for the public welfare
the ban would reduce the level of toxins in the
fish in Eagle Bay

5. Vandenburg: This art museum is not adhering to its
purpose. Its founders intended it to devote as
much attention to contemporary art as to the art of
earlier periods, but its collection of contemporary
art is far smaller than its other collections.
Simpson: The relatively small size of the museum’s
contemporary art collection is appropriate. It’s an
art museum, not an ethnographic museum
designed to collect every style of every period. Its
contemporary art collection is small because its
curators believe that there is little high-quality
contemporary art.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the reasoning in Simpson’s response to
Vandenburg?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

An art museum should collect only works that
its curators consider to be of high artistic
quality.
An art museum should not collect any works
that violate the purpose defined by the
museum’s founders.
An art museum’s purpose need not be to collect
every style of every period.
An ethnographic museum’s purpose should be
defined according to its curators’ beliefs.
The intentions of an art museum’s curators
should not determine what is collected by that
museum.

6. Over the last five years, every new major alternativeenergy initiative that initially was promised government
funding has since seen that funding severely curtailed.
In no such case has the government come even close to
providing the level of funds initially earmarked for these
projects. Since large corporations have made it a point
to discourage alternative-energy projects, it is likely that
the corporations’ actions influenced the government’s
funding decisions.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the reasoning above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

For the past two decades, most alternativeenergy initiatives have received little or no
government funding.
The funding initially earmarked for a
government project is always subject to
change, given the mechanisms by which the
political process operates.
The only research projects whose government
funding has been severely curtailed are those
that large corporations have made it a point to
discourage.
Some projects encouraged by large corporations
have seen their funding severely curtailed over
the last five years.
All large corporations have made it a point to
discourage some forms of research.

7. Talbert: Chess is beneficial for school-age children. It is
enjoyable, encourages foresight and logical
thinking, and discourages carelessness,
inattention, and impulsiveness. In short, it
promotes mental maturity.
Sklar: My objection to teaching chess to children is that
it diverts mental activity from something with
societal value, such as science, into something
that has no societal value.

9. Musicologist: Classification of a musical instrument
depends on the mechanical action through which
it produces music. So the piano is properly called
a percussion instrument, not a stringed
instrument. Even though the vibration of the
piano’s strings is what makes its sound, the
strings are caused to vibrate by the impact of
hammers.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the musicologist’s argument?

Talbert’s and Sklar’s statements provide the strongest
support for holding that they disagree with each other
over whether

(A)

(A)
(B)

(B)

(D)
(E)

chess promotes mental maturity
many activities promote mental maturity just as
well as chess does
chess is socially valuable and science is not
children should be taught to play chess
children who neither play chess nor study
science are mentally immature

8. Marcia: Not all vegetarian diets lead to nutritional
deficiencies. Research shows that vegetarians can
obtain a full complement of proteins and minerals
from nonanimal foods.
Theodora: You are wrong in claiming that vegetarianism
cannot lead to nutritional deficiencies. If most
people became vegetarians, some of those losing
jobs due to the collapse of many meat-based
industries would fall into poverty and hence be
unable to afford a nutritionally adequate diet.
Theodora’s reply to Marcia’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that her reply
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

is directed toward disproving a claim that
Marcia did not make

It is correct to classify the piano as a percussion
instrument rather than as a stringed instrument.

10. In a vast ocean region, phosphorus levels have doubled
in the past few decades due to agricultural runoff
pouring out of a large river nearby. The phosphorus
stimulates the growth of plankton near the ocean
surface. Decaying plankton fall to the ocean floor, where
bacteria devour them, consuming oxygen in the process.
Due to the resulting oxygen depletion, few fish can
survive in this region.
Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the information above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The agricultural runoff pouring out of the river
contributes to the growth of plankton near the
ocean surface.
Before phosphorus levels doubled in the ocean
region, most fish were able to survive in that
region.
If agricultural runoff ceased pouring out of the
river, there would be no bacteria on the ocean
floor devouring decaying plankton.
The quantity of agricultural runoff pouring out
of the river has doubled in the past few
decades.
The amount of oxygen in a body of water is in
general inversely proportional to the level of
phosphorus in that body of water.

11. Psychologists observing a shopping mall parking lot
found that, on average, drivers spent 39 seconds leaving
a parking space when another car was quietly waiting to
enter it, 51 seconds if the driver of the waiting car
honked impatiently, but only 32 seconds leaving a space
when no one was waiting. This suggests that drivers feel
possessive of their parking spaces even when leaving
them, and that this possessiveness increases in reaction
to indications that another driver wants the space.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
reasoning?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The more pressure most drivers feel because
others are waiting for them to perform
maneuvers with their cars, the less quickly
they are able to perform them.
The amount of time drivers spend entering a
parking space is not noticeably affected by
whether other drivers are waiting for them to
do so, nor by whether those other drivers are
honking impatiently.
It is considerably more difficult and timeconsuming for a driver to maneuver a car out
of a parking space if another car waiting to
enter that space is nearby.
Parking spaces in shopping mall parking lots
are unrepresentative of parking spaces in
general with respect to the likelihood that other
cars will be waiting to enter them.
Almost any driver leaving a parking space will
feel angry at another driver who honks
impatiently, and this anger will influence the
amount of time spent leaving the space.

12. Shark teeth are among the most common vertebrate
fossils; yet fossilized shark skeletons are much less
common—indeed, comparatively rare among fossilized
vertebrate skeletons.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent paradox described above?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Unlike the bony skeletons of other vertebrates,
shark skeletons are composed of cartilage, and
teeth and bone are much more likely to
fossilize than cartilage is.
The rare fossilized skeletons of sharks that are
found are often found in areas other than those
in which fossils of shark teeth are plentiful.
Fossils of sharks’ teeth are quite difficult to
distinguish from fossils of other kinds of teeth.
Some species of sharks alive today grow and
lose many sets of teeth during their lifetimes.
The physical and chemical processes involved
in the fossilization of sharks’ teeth are as
common as those involved in the fossilization
of shark skeletons.

13. Critic: Photographers, by deciding which subjects to
depict and how to depict them, express their own
worldviews in their photographs, however
realistically those photographs may represent
reality. Thus, photographs are interpretations of
reality.
The argument’s conclusion is properly drawn if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Even representing a subject realistically can
involve interpreting that subject.
To express a worldview is to interpret reality.
All visual art expresses the artist’s worldview.
Any interpretation of reality involves the
expression of a worldview.
Nonrealistic photographs, like realistic
photographs, express the worldviews of the
photographers who take them.

14. Geologists recently discovered marks that closely
resemble worm tracks in a piece of sandstone. These
marks were made more than half a billion years earlier
than the earliest known traces of multicellular animal
life. Therefore, the marks are probably the traces of
geological processes rather than of worms.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is sometimes difficult to estimate the precise
age of a piece of sandstone.
Geological processes left a substantial variety of
marks in sandstone more than half a billion
years before the earliest known multicellular
animal life existed.
There were some early life forms other than
worms that are known to have left marks that
are hard to distinguish from those found in the
piece of sandstone.
At the place where the sandstone was found,
the only geological processes that are likely to
mark sandstone in ways that resemble worm
tracks could not have occurred at the time the
marks were made.
Most scientists knowledgeable about early
animal life believe that worms are likely to
have been among the earliest forms of
multicellular animal life on Earth, but evidence
of their earliest existence is scarce because
they are composed solely of soft tissue.

15. Often a type of organ or body structure is the only
physically feasible means of accomplishing a given task,
so it should be unsurprising if, like eyes or wings, that
type of organ or body structure evolves at different
times in a number of completely unrelated species. After
all, whatever the difference of heritage and habitat, as
organisms animals have fundamentally similar needs
and so _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the last sentence of the passage?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

species quite different from themselves
will in many instances evolve similar
adaptations enabling them to satisfy these
needs
will develop adaptations allowing them to

16. Engineer: Thermophotovoltaic generators are devices
that convert heat into electricity. The process of
manufacturing steel produces huge amounts of
heat that currently go to waste. So if steelmanufacturing plants could feed the heat they
produce into thermophotovoltaic generators, they
would greatly reduce their electric bills, thereby
saving money.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the engineer’s argument depends?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

There is no other means of utilizing the heat
produced by the steel-manufacturing process
that would be more cost effective than
installing thermophotovoltaic generators.
Using current technology, it would be possible
for steel-manufacturing plants to feed the heat
they produce into thermophotovoltaic
generators in such a way that those generators
could convert at least some of that heat into
electricity.
The amount steel-manufacturing plants would
save on their electric bills by feeding heat into
thermophotovoltaic generators would be
sufficient to cover the cost of purchasing and
installing those generators.
At least some steel-manufacturing plants rely on
electricity as their primary source of energy in
the steel-manufacturing process.
There are at least some steel-manufacturing
plants that could greatly reduce their electricity
bills only if they used some method of
converting wasted heat or other energy from
the steel-manufacturing process into electricity.

17. Herbalist: While standard antibiotics typically have just
one active ingredient, herbal antibacterial
remedies typically contain several. Thus, such
herbal remedies are more likely to retain their
effectiveness against new, resistant strains of
bacteria than are standard antibiotics. For a strain
of bacteria, the difficulty of developing resistance
to an herbal antibacterial remedy is like a cook’s
difficulty in trying to prepare a single meal that
will please all of several dozen guests, a task far
more difficult than preparing one meal that will
please a single guest.
In the analogy drawn in the argument above, which one
of the following corresponds to a standard antibiotic?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

a single guest
several dozen guests
the pleasure experienced by a single guest
a cook
the ingredients available to a cook

18. To find out how barn owls learn how to determine the
direction from which sounds originate, scientists put
distorting lenses over the eyes of young barn owls
before the owls first opened their eyes. The owls with
these lenses behaved as if objects making sounds were
farther to the right than they actually were. Once the
owls matured, the lenses were removed, yet the owls
continued to act as if they misjudged the location of the
source of sounds. The scientists consequently
hypothesized that once a barn owl has developed an
auditory scheme for estimating the point from which
sounds originate, it ceases to use vision to locate sounds.
The scientists’ reasoning is vulnerable to which one of
the following criticisms?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

It fails to consider whether the owls’ vision was
permanently impaired by their having worn the
lenses while immature.
It assumes that the sense of sight is equally
good in all owls.
It attributes human reasoning processes to a
nonhuman organism.
It neglects to consider how similar distorting
lenses might affect the behavior of other bird
species.
It uses as evidence experimental results that
were irrelevant to the conclusion.

19. As often now as in the past, newspaper journalists use
direct or indirect quotation to report unsupported or
false claims made by newsmakers. However, journalists
are becoming less likely to openly challenge the veracity
of such claims within their articles.
Each of the following, if true, helps to explain the trend
in journalism described above EXCEPT:
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Newspaper publishers have found that many
readers will cancel a subscription simply
because a view they take for granted has been
disputed by the publication.
The areas of knowledge on which journalists
report are growing in specialization and
diversity, while journalists themselves are not
becoming more broadly knowledgeable.
Persons supporting controversial views more
and more frequently choose to speak only to
reporters who seem sympathetic to their views.
A basic principle of journalism holds that
debate over controversial issues draws the
attention of the public.
Journalists who challenge the veracity of claims
are often criticized for failing their professional
obligation to be objective.

20. When people show signs of having a heart attack an
electrocardiograph (EKG) is often used to diagnose their
condition. In a study, a computer program for EKG
diagnosis of heart attacks was pitted against a very
experienced, highly skilled cardiologist. The program
correctly diagnosed a significantly higher proportion of
the cases that were later confirmed to be heart attacks
than did the cardiologist. Interpreting EKG data,
therefore, should be left to computer programs.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Experts agreed that the cardiologist made few
obvious mistakes in reading and interpreting
the EKG data.
The practice of medicine is as much an art as a
science, and computer programs are not easily
adapted to making subjective judgments.
The cardiologist correctly diagnosed a
significantly higher proportion of the cases in
which no heart attack occurred than did the
computer program.
In a considerable percentage of cases, EKG data
alone are insufficient to enable either computer
programs or cardiologists to make accurate
diagnoses.
The cardiologist in the study was
unrepresentative of cardiologists in general
with respect to skill and experience.

21. A government study indicates that raising speed limits to
reflect the actual average speeds of traffic on level,
straight stretches of high-speed roadways reduces the
accident rate. Since the actual average speed for level,
straight stretches of high-speed roadways tends to be
120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per hour), that should
be set as a uniform national speed limit for level,
straight stretches of all such roadways.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the reasoning above?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Uniform national speed limits should apply only
to high-speed roadways.
Traffic laws applying to high-speed roadways
should apply uniformly across the nation.
A uniform national speed limit for high-speed
roadways should be set only if all such
roadways have roughly equal average speeds
of traffic.
Long-standing laws that are widely violated are
probably not good laws.
Any measure that reduces the rate of traffic
accidents should be implemented.

22. Psychiatrist: In treating first-year students at this
university, I have noticed that those reporting the
highest levels of spending on recreation score at
about the same level on standard screening
instruments for anxiety and depression as those
reporting the lowest levels of spending on
recreation. This suggests that the first-year
students with high levels of spending on
recreation could reduce that spending without
increasing their anxiety or depression.
Each of the following, if true, strengthens the
psychiatrist’s argument EXCEPT:
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

At other universities, first-year students
reporting the highest levels of spending on
recreation also show the same degree of
anxiety and depression as do those reporting
the lowest levels of such spending.
Screening of first-year students at the university
who report moderate levels of spending on
recreation reveals that those students are less
anxious and depressed than both those with the
highest and those with the lowest levels of
spending on recreation.
Among adults between the ages of 40 and 60,
increased levels of spending on recreation are
strongly correlated with decreased levels of
anxiety and depression.
The screening instruments used by the
psychiatrist are extremely accurate in revealing
levels of anxiety and depression among
university students.
Several of the psychiatrist’s patients who are
first-year students at the university have
reduced their spending on recreation from very
high levels to very low levels without
increasing their anxiety or depression.

Most of the houses on River Street that have front yards

analogy demonstrating that the reasoning in the
argument above is flawed?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

By that line of reasoning, we could conclude
that most politicians have run for office, since
all legislators are politicians and most
legislators have run for office.
By that line of reasoning, we could conclude
that most public servants are legislators, since
most legislators have run for office and most
politicians who have run for office are public
servants.
By that line of reasoning, we could conclude
that not every public servant has run for office,
since every legislator is a public servant but
some public servants are not legislators.
By that line of reasoning, we could conclude
that most legislators have never run for office,
since most public servants have never run for
office and all legislators are public servants.
By that line of reasoning, we could conclude
that most legislators are not public servants,
since most public servants have not run for
office and most legislators have run for office.

24. Historian: It is unlikely that someone would see history
as the working out of moral themes unless he or
she held clear and unambiguous moral beliefs.
However, one’s inclination to morally judge
human behavior decreases as one’s knowledge of
history increases. Consequently, the more history
a person knows, the less likely that person is to
view history as the working out of moral themes.
The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if
which one of the following is assumed?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Historical events that fail to elicit moral
disapproval are generally not considered to
exemplify a moral theme.
The less inclined one is to morally judge human
behavior, the less likely it is that one holds
clear and unambiguous moral beliefs.
Only those who do not understand human
history attribute moral significance to historical
events.
The more clear and unambiguous one’s moral
beliefs, the more likely one is to view history
as the working out of moral themes.
People tend to be less objective regarding a
subject about which they possess extensive
knowledge than regarding a subject about
which they do not possess extensive
knowledge.

25. A recent poll revealed that most students at our
university prefer that the university, which is searching
for a new president, hire someone who has extensive
experience as a university president. However, in the
very same poll, the person most students chose from
among a list of leading candidates as the one they
would most like to see hired was someone who has
never served as a university president.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
account for the apparent discrepancy in the students’
preferences?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Because several of the candidates listed in the
poll had extensive experience as university
presidents, not all of the candidates could be
differentiated on this basis alone.
Most of the candidates listed in the poll had
extensive experience as university presidents.
Students taking the poll had fewer candidates to
choose from than were currently being
considered for the position.
Most of the students taking the poll did not
know whether any of the leading candidates
listed in the poll had ever served as a
university president.
Often a person can be well suited to a position
even though they have relatively little
experience in such a position.

Questions 12–17
The coach of a women’s track team must determine which
four of five runners—Quinn, Ramirez, Smith, Terrell, and
Uzoma—will run in the four races of an upcoming track
meet. Each of the four runners chosen will run in exactly
one of the four races—the first, second, third, or fourth. The
coach’s selection is bound by the following constraints:
If Quinn runs in the track meet, then Terrell runs in the
race immediately after the race in which Quinn runs.
Smith does not run in either the second race or the
fourth race.
If Uzoma does not run in the track meet, then Ramirez
runs in the second race.
If Ramirez runs in the second race, then Uzoma does not
run in the track meet.

26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Among Trinidadian guppies, males with large spots are
more attractive to females than are males with small
spots, who consequently are presented with less frequent
mating opportunities. Yet guppies with small spots are
more likely to avoid detection by predators, so in waters
where predators are abundant only guppies with small
spots live to maturity.
The situation described above most closely conforms to
which one of the following generalizations?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

A trait that helps attract mates is sometimes
more dangerous to one sex than to another.
Those organisms that are most attractive to the
opposite sex have the greatest number of
offspring.
Those organisms that survive the longest have
the greatest number of offspring.
Whether a trait is harmful to the organisms of a
species can depend on which sex possesses it.
A trait that is helpful to procreation can also
hinder it in certain environments.

2. Programmer: We computer programmers at Mytheco are
demanding raises to make our average salary
comparable with that of the technical writers here
who receive, on average, 20 percent more in salary
and benefits than we do. This pay difference is
unfair and intolerable.
Mytheco executive: But many of the technical writers
have worked for Mytheco longer than have
many of the programmers. Since salary and
benefits at Mytheco are directly tied to seniority,
the 20 percent pay difference you mention is
perfectly acceptable.

3. Cable TV stations have advantages that enable them to
attract many more advertisers than broadcast networks
attract. For example, cable stations are able to target
particular audiences with 24-hour news, sports, or movies,
whereas broadcast networks must offer a variety of
programming. Cable can also offer lower advertising
rates than any broadcast network can, because it is
subsidized by viewers through subscriber fees.
Additionally, many cable stations have expanded
worldwide with multinational programming.
The statements above, if true, provide support for each
of the following EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

4. In polluted industrial English cities during the Industrial
Revolution, two plant diseases—black spot, which infects
roses, and tar spot, which infects sycamore trees—
disappeared. It is likely that air pollution eradicated
these diseases.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the reasoning above?
(A)

Evaluating the adequacy of the Mytheco executive’s
response requires a clarification of which one of the
following?

(B)

(A)

(C)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

whether any of the technical writers at Mytheco
once worked as programmers at the company
how the average seniority of programmers
compares with the average seniority of
technical writers
whether the sorts of benefits an employee of
Mytheco receives are tied to the salary of
that employee
whether the Mytheco executive was at one time
a technical writer employed by Mytheco
how the Mytheco executive’s salary compares
with that of the programmers

Some broadcast networks can be viewed in
several countries.
Broadcast networks do not rely on subscriber
fees from viewers.
Low costs are often an important factor for
advertisers in selecting a station or network on
which to run a TV ad.
Some advertisers prefer to have the opportunity
to address a worldwide audience.
The audiences that some advertisers prefer to
target watch 24-hour news stations.

(D)
(E)

Scientists theorize that some plants can develop
a resistance to air pollution.
Certain measures help prevent infection by
black spot and tar spot, but once infection
occurs, it is very difficult to eliminate.
For many plant species, scientists have not
determined the effects of air pollution.
Black spot and tar spot returned when the air in
the cities became less polluted.
Black spot and tar spot were the only plant
diseases that disappeared in any English cities
during the Industrial Revolution.

5. Many scholars are puzzled about who created the
seventeenth-century abridgment of Shakespeare’s Hamlet
contained in the First Quarto. Two facts about the work
shed light on this question. First, the person who undertook
the abridgment clearly did not possess a copy of Hamlet.
Second, the abridgment contains a very accurate rendering
of the speeches of one of the characters, but a slipshod
handling of all the other parts.
Which one of the following statements is most supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

6.

The abridgment was prepared by Shakespeare.
The abridgment was created to make Hamlet
easier to produce on stage.
The abridgment was produced by an actor who
had played a role in Hamlet.
The abridgement was prepared by a spectator of
a performance of Hamlet.
The abridgment was produced by an actor who
was trying to improve the play.

Musicologist: Many critics complain of the disproportion
between text and music in Handel’s da capo arias.
These texts are generally quite short and often
repeated well beyond what is needed for literal
understanding. Yet such criticism is refuted by
noting that repetition serves a vital function: it
frees the audience to focus on the music itself,
which can speak to audiences whatever their
language.

7. Baxe Interiors, one of the largest interior design companies
in existence, currently has a near monopoly in the
corporate market. Several small design companies have
won prestigious awards for their corporate work, while
Baxe has won none. Nonetheless, the corporate managers
who solicit design proposals will only contract with
companies they believe are unlikely to go bankrupt, and
they believe that only very large companies are unlikely
to go bankrupt.
The statements above, if true, most strongly support
which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

There are other very large design companies
besides Baxe, but they produce designs that
are inferior to Baxe’s.
Baxe does not have a near monopoly in the
market of any category of interior design other
than corporate interiors.
For the most part, designs that are produced
by small companies are superior to the designs
produced by Baxe.
At least some of the corporate managers who
solicit design proposals are unaware that there
are designs that are much better than those
produced by Baxe.
The existence of interior designs that are
superior to those produced by Baxe does not
currently threaten its near monopoly in the
corporate market.

Which one of the following sentences best expresses the
main point of the musicologist’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Handel’s da capo arias contain a disproportionate
amount of music.
Handel’s da capo arias are superior to most in
their accessibility to diverse audiences.
At least one frequent criticism of Handel’s
da capo arias is undeserved.
At least some of Handel’s da capo arias contain
unnecessary repetitions.
Most criticism of Handel’s da capo arias is
unwarranted.

8. The giant Chicxulub crater in Mexico provides
indisputable evidence that a huge asteroid, about
six miles across, struck Earth around the time many of
the last dinosaur species were becoming extinct. But this
catastrophe was probably not responsible for most of
these extinctions. Any major asteroid strike kills many
organisms in or near the region of the impact, but there
is little evidence that such a strike could have a
worldwide effect. Indeed, some craters even larger than
the Chicxulub crater were made during times in Earth’s
history when there were no known extinctions.
Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken
the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The vast majority of dinosaur species are
known to have gone extinct well before the
time of the asteroid impact that produced the
Chicxulub crater.
The size of a crater caused by an asteroid
striking Earth generally depends on both the
size of that asteroid and the force of its impact.
Fossils have been discovered of a number
of dinosaurs that clearly died as a result of
the asteroid impact that produced the
Chicxulub crater.
There is no evidence that any other asteroid of
equal size struck Earth at the same time as the
asteroid that produced the Chicxulub crater.
During the period immediately before the asteroid
that produced the Chicxulub crater struck, most
of the world’s dinosaurs lived in or near the
region of the asteroid’s impending impact.

9. In a sample containing 1,000 peanuts from lot A and
1,000 peanuts from lot B, 50 of the peanuts from lot A
were found to be infected with Aspergillus. Two hundred
of the peanuts from lot B were found to be infected
with Aspergillus. Therefore, infection with Aspergillus
is more widespread in lot B than in lot A.
The reasoning in which one of the following is most
similar to the reasoning in the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Every one of these varied machine parts is of
uniformly high quality. Therefore, the machine
that we assemble from them will be of equally
high quality.
If a plant is carelessly treated, it is likely to
develop blight. If a plant develops blight, it is
likely to die. Therefore, if a plant is carelessly
treated, it is likely to die.
In the past 1,000 experiments, whenever an
experimental fungicide was applied to coffee
plants infected with coffee rust, the infection
disappeared. The coffee rust never disappeared
before the fungicide was applied. Therefore, in
these experiments, application of the fungicide
caused the disappearance of coffee rust.
Three thousand registered voters—1,500 members
of the Liberal party and 1,500 members of the
Conservative party—were asked which mayoral
candidate they favored. Four hundred of the
Liberals and 300 of the Conservatives favored
Pollack. Therefore, Pollack has more support
among Liberals than among Conservatives.

10. Economist: If the belief were to become widespread
that losing one’s job is not a sign of personal
shortcomings but instead an effect of impersonal
social forces (which is surely correct), there
would be growth in the societal demand for more
government control of the economy to protect
individuals from these forces, just as the
government now protects them from military
invasion. Such extensive government control of
the economy would lead to an economic
disaster, however.
The economist’s statements, if true, most strongly
support which one of the following?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Increased knowledge of the causes of job loss
could lead to economic disaster.
An individual’s belief in his or her own abilities
is the only reliable protection against
impersonal social forces.
Governments should never interfere with
economic forces.
Societal demand for government control of the
economy is growing.
In general, people should feel no more
responsible for economic disasters than for
military invasions.

11. A development company has proposed building an
airport near the city of Dalton. If the majority of Dalton’s
residents favor the proposal, the airport will be built.
However, it is unlikely that a majority of Dalton’s
residents would favor the proposal, for most of them
believe that the airport would create noise problems.
Thus, it is unlikely that the airport will be built.
The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the
argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

treats a sufficient condition for the airport’s
being built as a necessary condition
concludes that something must be true, because
most people believe it to be true
concludes, on the basis that a certain event is
unlikely to occur, that the event will not occur
fails to consider whether people living near
Dalton would favor building the airport
overlooks the possibility that a new airport
could benefit the local economy

12. After the rush-hour speed limit on the British M25
motorway was lowered from 70 miles per hour
(115 kilometers per hour) to 50 miles per hour
(80 kilometers per hour), rush-hour travel times
decreased by approximately 15 percent.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the decrease in travel times described above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

After the decrease in the rush-hour speed limit,
the average speed on the M25 was significantly
lower during rush hours than at other times of
the day.
Travel times during periods other than rush
hours were essentially unchanged after the
rush-hour speed limit was lowered.
Before the rush-hour speed limit was lowered,
rush-hour accidents that caused lengthy delays
were common, and most of these accidents
were caused by high-speed driving.
Enforcement of speed limits on the M25 was
quite rigorous both before and after the rush-hour
speed limit was lowered.
The number of people who drive on the M25
during rush hours did not increase after the
rush-hour speed limit was lowered.

13. An art critic, by ridiculing an artwork, can undermine
the pleasure one takes in it; conversely, by lavishing
praise upon an artwork, an art critic can render the
experience of viewing the artwork more pleasurable. So
an artwork’s artistic merit can depend not only on the
person who creates it but also on those who critically
evaluate it.
The conclusion can be properly drawn if which one of
the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The merit of an artistic work is determined by
the amount of pleasure it elicits.
Most people lack the confidence necessary for
making their own evaluations of art.
Art critics understand what gives an artwork
artistic merit better than artists do.
Most people seek out critical reviews of particular
artworks before viewing those works.
The pleasure people take in something is
typically influenced by what they think others
feel about it.

14. The number of automobile thefts has declined steadily
during the past five years, and it is more likely now
than it was five years ago that someone who steals a car
will be convicted of the crime.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain
the facts cited above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Although there are fewer car thieves now than
there were five years ago, the proportion of
thieves who tend to abandon cars before their
owners notice that they have been stolen has
also decreased.
Car alarms are more common than they were
five years ago, but their propensity to be
triggered in the absence of any criminal activity
has resulted in people generally ignoring them
when they are triggered.
An upsurge in home burglaries over the last
five years has required police departments to
divert limited resources to investigation of
these cases.
Because of the increasingly lucrative market for
stolen automobile parts, many stolen cars are
quickly disassembled and the parts are sold to
various buyers across the country.
There are more adolescent car thieves now than
there were five years ago, and the sentences
given to young criminals tend to be far more
lenient than those given to adult criminals.

15. Legislator: My staff conducted a poll in which my
constituents were asked whether they favor high
taxes. More than 97 percent answered “no.”
Clearly, then, my constituents would support the
bill I recently introduced, which reduces the
corporate income tax.
The reasoning in the legislator’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

fails to establish that the opinions of the
legislator’s constituents are representative of the
opinions of the country’s population as a whole
fails to consider whether the legislator’s
constituents consider the current corporate
income tax a high tax
confuses an absence of evidence that the
legislator’s constituents oppose a bill with the
existence of evidence that the legislator’s
constituents support that bill
draws a conclusion that merely restates a claim
presented in support of that conclusion
treats a result that proves that the public
supports a bill as a result that is merely
consistent with public support for that bill

16. Many nursing homes have prohibitions against having
pets, and these should be lifted. The presence of an
animal companion can yield health benefits by reducing
a person’s stress. A pet can also make one’s time at a
home more rewarding, which will be important to more
people as the average life span of our population increases.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn in the argument above?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

As the average life span increases, it will be
important to more people that life in nursing
homes be rewarding.
Residents of nursing homes should enjoy the
same rewarding aspects of life as anyone else.
The policy that many nursing homes have
should be changed so that residents are allowed
to have pets.
Having a pet can reduce one’s stress and
thereby make one a healthier person.
The benefits older people derive from having
pets need to be recognized, especially as the
average life span increases.

17. Near many cities, contamination of lakes and rivers
from pollutants in rainwater runoff exceeds that from
industrial discharge. As the runoff washes over buildings
and pavements, it picks up oil and other pollutants.
Thus, water itself is among the biggest water polluters.
The statement that contamination of lakes and rivers
from pollutants in rainwater runoff exceeds that from
industrial discharge plays which one of the following
roles in the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is a conclusion for which the claim that water
itself should be considered a polluter is offered
as support.
It is cited as evidence that pollution from
rainwater runoff is a more serious problem
than pollution from industrial discharge.
It is a generalization based on the observation
that rainwater runoff picks up oil and other
pollutants as it washes over buildings and
pavements.
It is a premise offered in support of the
conclusion that water itself is among the
biggest water polluters.
It is stated to provide an example of a typical
kind of city pollution.

18. Wong: Although all countries are better off as democracies,
a transitional autocratic stage is sometimes
required before a country can become democratic.
Tate: The freedom and autonomy that democracy
provides are of genuine value, but the simple
material needs of people are more important.
Some countries can better meet these needs as
autocracies than as democracies.
Wong’s and Tate’s statements provide the most support
for the claim that they disagree over the truth of which
one of the following?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

There are some countries that are better off as
autocracies than as democracies.
Nothing is more important to a country than the
freedom and autonomy of the individuals who
live in that country.
In some cases, a country cannot become a
democracy.
The freedom and autonomy that democracy
provides are of genuine value.
All democracies succeed in meeting the simple
material needs of people.

19. Principle: When none of the fully qualified candidates
for a new position at Arvue Corporation currently

who would be most productive in that position.
Application: Arvue should not hire Krall for the new
position, because Delacruz is a candidate and is
fully qualified.

20. Many important types of medicine have been developed
from substances discovered in plants that grow only in
tropical rain forests. There are thousands of plant
species in these rain forests that have not yet been
studied by scientists, and it is very likely that many such
plants also contain substances of medicinal value. Thus,
if the tropical rain forests are not preserved, important
types of medicine will never be developed.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

There are substances of medicinal value contained
in tropical rain forest plants not yet studied by
scientists that differ from those substances
already discovered in tropical rain forest plants.
Most of the tropical rain forest plants that contain
substances of medicinal value can also be
found growing in other types of environment.
The majority of plant species that are unique to
tropical rain forests and that have been studied
by scientists have been discovered to contain
substances of medicinal value.
Any substance of medicinal value contained in
plant species indigenous to tropical rain forests
will eventually be discovered if those species
are studied by scientists.
The tropical rain forests should be preserved to
make it possible for important medicines to be
developed from plant species that have not yet
been studied by scientists.

(E)

All of the candidates are fully qualified for the
new position, but none already works for Arvue.
Of all the candidates who do not already work
for Arvue, Delacruz would be the most
productive in the new position.
Krall works for Arvue, but Delacruz is the
candidate who would be most productive in
the new position.
Several candidates currently work for Arvue,
but Krall and Delacruz do not.
None of the candidates already works for Arvue,
and Delacruz is the candidate who would be
most productive in the new position.

21. In modern deep-diving marine mammals, such as whales,
the outer shell of the bones is porous. This has the
effect of making the bones light enough so that it is
easy for the animals to swim back to the surface after
a deep dive. The outer shell of the bones was also
porous in the ichthyosaur, an extinct prehistoric marine
reptile. We can conclude from this that ichthyosaurs
were deep divers.

23. Columnist: Although much has been learned, we are still
largely ignorant of the intricate interrelationships
among species of living organisms. We should,
therefore, try to preserve the maximum number
of species if we have an interest in preserving
any, since allowing species toward which we are
indifferent to perish might undermine the viability
of other species.

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the columnist’s argument?

(A)

(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Some deep-diving marine species must surface
after dives but do not have bones with porous
outer shells.
In most modern marine reptile species, the outer
shell of the bones is not porous.
In most modern and prehistoric marine reptile
species that are not deep divers, the outer shell
of the bones is porous.
In addition to the porous outer shells of their
bones, whales have at least some characteristics
suited to deep diving for which there is no
clear evidence whether these were shared
by ichthyosaurs.
There is evidence that the bones of ichthyosaurs
would have been light enough to allow surfacing
even if the outer shells were not porous.

22. Librarian: Some argue that the preservation grant we
received should be used to restore our original
copy of our town’s charter, since if the charter is
not restored, it will soon deteriorate beyond
repair. But this document, although sentimentally
important, has no scholarly value. Copies are
readily available. Since we are a research library
and not a museum, the money would be better
spent preserving documents that have significant
scholarly value.
The claim that the town’s charter, if not restored, will
soon deteriorate beyond repair plays which one of the
following roles in the librarian’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is a claim that the librarian’s argument
attempts to show to be false.
It is the conclusion of the argument that the
librarian’s argument rejects.
It is a premise in an argument whose conclusion
is rejected by the librarian’s argument.
It is a premise used to support the librarian’s
main conclusion.
It is a claim whose truth is required by the
librarian’s argument.

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is strongly in our interest to preserve certain
plant and animal species.
We should not take any action until all relevant
scientific facts have been established and taken
into account.
We should not allow the number of species to
diminish any further than is necessary for the
flourishing of present and future human
populations.
We should not allow a change to occur unless
we are assured that that change will not
jeopardize anything that is important to us.
We should always undertake the course of
action that is likely to have the best
consequences in the immediate future.

24. One is likely to feel comfortable approaching a stranger
if the stranger is of one’s approximate age. Therefore,
long-term friends are probably of the same approximate
age as each other since most long-term friendships begin
because someone felt comfortable approaching a stranger.
The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that it
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

presumes, without warrant, that one is likely to
feel uncomfortable approaching a person only
if that person is a stranger
infers that a characteristic is present in a situation
from the fact that that characteristic is present
in most similar situations
overlooks the possibility that one is less likely
to feel comfortable approaching someone who
is one’s approximate age if that person is a
stranger than if that person is not a stranger
presumes, without warrant, that one never
approaches a stranger unless one feels
comfortable doing so
fails to address whether one is likely to feel
comfortable approaching a stranger who is not
one’s approximate age

25. There can be no individual freedom without the rule of
law, for there is no individual freedom without social
integrity, and pursuing the good life is not possible
without social integrity.
The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

There can be no rule of law without social
integrity.
There can be no social integrity without the
rule of law.
One cannot pursue the good life without the
rule of law.
Social integrity is possible only if individual
freedom prevails.
There can be no rule of law without individual
freedom.

26. Economist: Countries with an uneducated population are
destined to be weak economically and politically,
whereas those with an educated population have
governments that display a serious financial
commitment to public education. So any nation
with a government that has made such a
commitment will avoid economic and political
weakness.
The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the
following arguments is most similar to that in the
economist’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Animal species with a very narrow diet will
have more difficulty surviving if the climate
suddenly changes, but a species with a broader
diet will not; for changes in the climate can
remove the traditional food supply.
People incapable of empathy are not good
candidates for public office, but those who do
have the capacity for empathy are able to
manipulate others easily; hence, people who
can manipulate others are good candidates for
public office.
People who cannot give orders are those who
do not understand the personalities of the
people to whom they give orders. Thus, those
who can give orders are those who understand
the personalities of the people to whom they
give orders.
Poets who create poetry of high quality are
those who have studied traditional poetry,
because poets who have not studied traditional
poetry are the poets most likely to create
something shockingly inventive, and poetry
that is shockingly inventive is rarely fine poetry.
People who dislike exercise are unlikely to lose
weight without sharply curtailing their food
intake; but since those who dislike activity
generally tend to avoid it, people who like to
eat but dislike exercise will probably fail to
lose weight.
