25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
Questions 1-2

3.

Politician: The funding for the new nationwide
health-awareness campaign should come from an
increase in taxes on cigarettes. It is well established
that cigarette smoking causes many serious health
problems, and it is only reasonable that people whose
unhealthful habits cause so many health problems
should bear the costs of that campaign.

Each of the following, if true, strengthens the argument
above EXCEPT:
(A)

Smoker: But it is equally well established that regularly
eating high-fat, high-cholesterol foods causes as
many serious health problems as does smoking, yet it
would be manifestly unreasonable to force those who
purchase such foods to bear the burden of ﬁnancing
this campaign.
1.

(B)
(C)
(D)

Which one of the following is the point at issue between
the politician and the smoker?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

whether the politician’s proposal for ﬁnancing
the health-awareness campaign is an
unreasonable one
whether smokers are more aware of the harmful
effects of their habit than are people who
regularly eat high-fat, high-cholesterol foods
whether the effects of smoking constitute a
greater health hazard than do the effects of
regularly eating high-fat, high-cholesterol foods
whether it is unreasonable to require people
who do not beneﬁt from certain governmental
programs to share the costs of those programs
whether the proposed increase on cigarette taxes
is an efﬁcient means of ﬁnancing the healthawareness campaign

There should be a greater use of gasohol. Gasohol is
a mixture of alcohol and gasoline, and has a higher
octane rating and fewer carbon monoxide emissions
than straight gasoline. Burning gasohol adds no more
carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than plants remove by
photosynthesis.

(E)
4.

Cats spend much of their time sleeping; they seem
to awaken only to stretch and yawn. Yet they have a
strong, agile musculature that most animals would have
to exercise strenuously to acquire.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent paradox described above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

2.

The smoker’s response to the politician’s argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

offers a counterexample that calls into question
the politician’s reasoning
presents an alternative solution to that proposed
by the politician
argues that the method proposed by the politician
would be inadequate for its intended purpose
questions the accuracy of the information cited
by the politician in reaching a conclusion
illustrates how the politician’s proposal could
aggravate the problem it is intended to solve

Cars run less well on gasoline than they do on
gasohol.
Since less gasoline is needed with the use of
gasohol, an energy shortage is less likely.
Cars burn on the average slightly more gasohol
per kilometer than they do gasoline.
Gasohol is cheaper to produce and hence costs
less at the pump than gasoline.
Burning gasoline adds more carbon dioxide to
the atmosphere than plants can remove.

(E)

Cats have a greater physiological need for sleep
than other animals.
Many other animals also spend much of
their time sleeping yet have a strong, agile
musculature.
Cats are able to sleep in apparently
uncomfortable positions.
Cats derive ample exercise from frequent
stretching.
Cats require strength and agility in order to be
effective predators.

Barnes: The two newest employees at this company
have salaries that are too high for the simple tasks
normally assigned to new employees and duties
that are too complex for inexperienced workers.
Hence, the salaries and the complexity of the
duties of these two newest employees should be
reduced.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
Barnes’s argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

6.

The duties of the two newest employees are not
less complex than any others in the company.
It is because of the complex duties assigned that
the two newest employees are being paid more
than is usually paid to newly hired employees.
The two newest employees are not experienced
at their occupations.
Barnes was not hired at a higher-than-average
starting salary.
The salaries of the two newest employees are no
higher than the salaries that other companies
pay for workers with a similar level of
experience.

These days, drug companies and health professionals
alike are focusing their attention on cholesterol in the
blood. The more cholesterol we have in our blood,
the higher the risk that we shall die of a heart attack.
The issue is pertinent since heart disease kills more
North Americans every year than any other single
cause. At least three factorssmoking, drinking, and
exercisecan each inﬂuence levels of cholesterol in the
blood.
Which one of the following can be properly concluded
from the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

If a person has low blood cholesterol, then that
person’s risk of fatal heart disease is low.
Smoking in moderation can entail as great a risk
of fatal heart disease as does heavy smoking.
A high-cholesterol diet is the principal cause of
death in North America.
The only way that smoking increases one’s risk
of fatal heart disease is by inﬂuencing the levels
of cholesterol in the blood.
The risk of fatal heart disease can be altered by
certain changes in lifestyle.

7.

In Debbie’s magic act, a volunteer supposedly selects
a card in a random fashion, looks at it without showing
it to her, and replaces it in the deck. After several
shufﬂes, Debbie cuts the deck and supposedly reveals
the same selected card. A skeptic conducted three trials.
In the ﬁrst, Debbie was videotaped, and no sleight
of hand was found. In the second, the skeptic instead
supplied a standard deck of cards. For the third trial, the
skeptic selected the card. Each time, Debbie apparently
revealed the selected card. The skeptic concluded that
Debbie uses neither sleight of hand, nor a trick deck,
nor a planted “volunteer” to achieve her effect.
Which one of the following most accurately describes a
ﬂaw in the skeptic’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

The skeptic failed to consider the possibility that
Debbie did not always use the same method to
achieve her effect.
The skeptic failed to consider the possibility that
sleight of hand could also be detected by some
means other than videotaping.
The skeptic failed to consider the possibility that
Debbie requires both sleight of hand and a trick
deck to achieve her effect.
The skeptic failed to consider the possibility that
Debbie used something other than sleight of
hand, a trick deck, or a planted “volunteer” to
achieve her effect.
The skeptic failed to consider the possibility
that Debbie’s success in the three trials was
something other than a coincidence.

Nutritionist: Many people claim that simple
carbohydrates are a reasonable caloric replacement
for the fatty foods forbidden to those on low-fat
diets. This is now in doubt. New studies show
that, for many people, a high intake of simple
carbohydrates stimulates an overproduction of
insulin, a hormone that is involved in processing
sugars and starches to create energy when the body
requires energy, or, when energy is not required, to
store the resulting by-products as fat.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps resolve
the apparent discrepancy in the information above?

Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the nutritionist’s statements?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

10. The symptoms of hepatitis A appear no earlier than
60 days after a person has been infected. In a test of
a hepatitis A vaccine, 50 people received the vaccine
and 50 people received a harmless placebo. Although
some people from each group eventually exhibited
symptoms of hepatitis A, the vaccine as used in the test
is completely effective in preventing infection with the
hepatitis A virus.

People on low-fat diets should avoid consumption
of simple carbohydrates if they wish to maintain
the energy that their bodies require.
People who produce enough insulin to process
their intake of simple carbohydrates should not
feel compelled to adopt low-fat diets.
People who consume simple carbohydrates should
limit their intake of foods high in fat.
People who wish to avoid gaining body fat
should limit their intake of foods high in simple
carbohydrates.
People who do not produce an excessive amount
of insulin when they consume foods high in
simple carbohydrates will not lose weight if they
restrict only their intake of these foods.

Jean: Our navigational equipment sells for $1,100 and
dominates the high end of the market, but more
units are sold by our competitors in the $700 to
$800 range. We should add a low-cost model,
which would allow us to increase our overall sales
while continuing to dominate the high end.
Tracy: I disagree. Our equipment sells to consumers
who associate our company with quality. Moving
into the low-cost market would put our competitors
in the high-cost market on an equal footing with us,
which could hurt our overall sales.
Jean’s and Tracy’s statements most strongly suggest
that they disagree over which one of the following
propositions?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

There is a greater potential for proﬁts in the lowcost market than there is in the high-cost market.
The proposed cheaper model, if it were made
available, would sell to customers who would
otherwise be buying the company’s present
model.
The company could dominate the low-cost market
in the same way it has dominated the high-cost
market.
The company would no longer dominate the
high-cost market if it began selling a low-cost
model.
Decreased sales of the high-cost model would
result in poor sales for the proposed low-cost
model.

(C)
(D)
(E)

The placebo did not produce any side effects that
resembled any of the symptoms of hepatitis A.
More members of the group that had received
the placebo recognized their symptoms as
symptoms of hepatitis A than did members of
the group that had received the vaccine.
The people who received the placebo were in
better overall physical condition than were the
people who received the vaccine.
The vaccinated people who exhibited symptoms
of hepatitis A were infected with the hepatitis A
virus before being vaccinated.
Of the people who developed symptoms of
hepatitis A, those who received the vaccine
recovered more quickly, on average, than those
who did not.

Questions 11-12
11
It is well known that many species adapt to their
environment, but it is usually assumed that only the most
highly evolved species alter their environment in ways
that aid their own survival. However, this characteristic is
actually quite common. Certain species of plankton, for
example, generate a gas that is converted in the atmosphere
into particles of sulfate. These particles cause water vapor
to condense, thus forming clouds. Indeed, the formation of
clouds over the ocean largely depends on the presence of
these particles. More cloud cover means more sunlight is
reﬂected, and so the Earth absorbs less heat. Thus plankton
cause the surface of the Earth to be cooler and this beneﬁts
the plankton.
11. Of the following, which one most accurately expresses
the main point of the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The Earth would be far warmer than it is now if
certain species of plankton became extinct.
By altering their environment in ways that
improve their chances of survival, certain
species of plankton beneﬁt the Earth as a whole.
Improving their own chances of survival by
altering the environment is not limited to the
most highly evolved species.
The extent of the cloud cover over the oceans is
largely determined by the quantity of plankton
in those oceans.
Species such as plankton alter the environment in
ways that are less detrimental to the well-being
of other species than are the alterations to the
environment made by more highly evolved
species.

12. Which one of the following accurately describes the
argumentative strategy employed?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

A general principle is used to justify a claim
made about a particular case to which that
principle has been shown to apply.
An explanation of how a controversial
phenomenon could have come about is given in
order to support the claim that this phenomenon
did in fact come about.
A generalization about the conditions under
which a certain process can occur is advanced
on the basis of an examination of certain cases
in which that process did occur.
A counterexample to a position being challenged
is presented in order to show that this position is
incorrect.
A detailed example is used to illustrate the
advantage of one strategy over another.

13. The top priority of the school administration should be
student attendance. No matter how good the teachers,
texts, and facilities are, none of these does any good if
few students come to school.
The pattern of reasoning in the argument above is
LEAST similar to that in which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The top priority of a salesperson should be not
to alienate customers. Honesty and a good
knowledge of the product line are useful to a
salesperson only if the customer feels at ease.
The top priority of a person lost in the wilderness
should be food-gathering. Knowing how to ﬁnd
one’s way back or how to build a comfortable
shelter does one no good if one does not have
enough food to survive.
The top priority of a detective should be to
gather physical evidence. High-tech crime
lab equipment and the most sophisticated
criminological analysis are of no use if crucial
clues are not gathered.
The top priority of a library should be
to maintain its collection of books. A
knowledgeable staff and beautiful facilities are
of no value if there is an inadequate supply of
books to lend.
The top priority of a criminal defense lawyer
should be to ensure that innocent clients are
found not guilty. Such clients can justly be
released from jail and resume their normal lives
if they are found not guilty.

14. Prosecutor: Dr. Yuge has testiﬁed that, had the robbery
occurred after 1:50 A.M., then, the moon having
set at 1:45 A.M., it would have been too dark
for Klein to recognize the perpetrator. But Yuge
acknowledged that the moon was full enough to
provide considerable light before it set. And we
have conclusively shown that the robbery occurred
between 1:15 and 1:30 A.M. So there was enough
light for Klein to make a reliable identiﬁcation.
The prosecutor’s reasoning is most vulnerable to
criticism because it overlooks which one of the
following possibilities?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Klein may be mistaken about the time of the
robbery and so it may have taken place after the
moon had set.
The perpetrator may closely resemble someone
who was not involved in the robbery.
Klein may have been too upset to make a reliable
identiﬁcation even in good light.
Without having been there, Dr. Yuge has no way
of knowing whether the light was sufﬁcient.
During the robbery the moon’s light may have
been interfered with by conditions such as cloud
cover.

15. Ordinary mountain sickness, a common condition
among mountain climbers, and one from which most
people can recover, is caused by the characteristic
shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere at high altitudes.
Cerebral edema, a rarer disruption of blood circulation
in the brain that quickly becomes life-threatening if not
correctly treated from its onset, can also be caused by
a shortage of oxygen. Since the symptoms of cerebral
edema resemble those of ordinary mountain sickness,
cerebral edema is especially dangerous at high altitudes.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The treatment for ordinary mountain sickness
differs from the treatment for cerebral edema.
Cerebral edema can cause those who suffer from
it to slip into a coma within a few hours.
Unlike cerebral edema, ordinary mountain
sickness involves no disruption of blood
circulation in the brain.
Shortage of oxygen at extremely high altitudes
is likely to affect thinking processes and cause
errors of judgment.
Most people who suffer from ordinary mountain
sickness recover without any special treatment.

16. We can learn about the living conditions of a vanished
culture by examining its language. Thus, it is likely
that the people who spoke Proto-Indo-European, the
language from which all Indo-European languages
descended, lived in a cold climate, isolated from ocean
or sea, because Proto-Indo-European lacks a word for
“sea,” yet contains words for “winter,” “snow,” and
“wolf.”
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A word meaning “ﬁsh” was used by the people
who spoke Proto-Indo-European.
Some languages lack words for prominent
elements of the environments of their speakers.
There are no known languages today that lack a
word for “sea.”
Proto-Indo-European possesses words for “heat.”
The people who spoke Proto-Indo-European
were nomadic.

17. Columnist: It is impossible for there to be real
evidence that lax radiation standards that were
once in effect at nuclear reactors actually
contributed to the increase in cancer rates near
such sites. The point is a familiar one: who
can say if a particular case of cancer is due to
radiation, exposure to environmental toxins,
smoking, poor diet, or genetic factors.
The argument’s reasoning is most vulnerable to
criticism on which one of the following grounds?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The argument fails to recognize that there may
be convincing statistical evidence even if
individual causes cannot be known.
The argument inappropriately presupposes that
what follows a certain phenomenon was caused
by that phenomenon.
The argument inappropriately draws a conclusion
about causes of cancer in general from evidence
drawn from a particular case of cancer.
The argument ignores other possible causes of
the increase in cancer rates near the nuclear
reactor complexes.
The argument concludes that a claim about a
causal connection is false on the basis of a lack
of evidence for the claim.

18. Some planning committee membersthose
representing the construction industryhave signiﬁcant
ﬁnancial interests in the committee’s decisions. No one
who is on the planning committee lives in the suburbs,
although many of them work there.
If the statements above are true, which one of the
following must also be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

No persons with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial interests in
the planning committee’s decisions are not in
the construction industry.
No person who has a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial interest
in the planning committee’s decisions lives in
the suburbs.
Some persons with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial interests
in the planning committee’s decisions work in
the suburbs.
Some planning committee members who
represent the construction industry do not work
in the suburbs.
Some persons with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial interests
in the planning committee’s decisions do not
live in the suburbs.

19. Arbitrator: The shipping manager admits that he
decided to close the old facility on October 14 and
to schedule the new facility’s opening for October
17, the following Monday. But he also claims
that he is not responsible for the business that
was lost due to the new facility’s failing to open
as scheduled. He blames the contractor for not
ﬁnishing on time, but he, too, is to blame, for he
was aware of the contractor’s typical delays and
should have planned for this contingency.

20. The price of a full-fare coach ticket from Toronto to
Dallas on Breezeway Airlines is the same today as it
was a year ago, if inﬂation is taken into account by
calculating prices in constant dollars. However, today
90 percent of the Toronto-to-Dallas coach tickets
that Breezeway sells are discount tickets and only 10
percent are full-fare tickets, whereas a year ago half
were discount tickets and half were full-fare tickets.
Therefore, on average, people pay less today in constant
dollars for a Breezeway Toronto-to-Dallas coach ticket
than they did a year ago.
Which one of the following, if assumed, would allow
the conclusion above to be properly drawn?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

A Toronto-to-Dallas full-fare coach ticket on
Breezeway Airlines provides ticket-holders with
a lower level of service today than such a ticket
provided a year ago.
A Toronto-to-Dallas discount coach ticket
on Breezeway Airlines costs about the same
amount in constant dollars today as it did a year
ago.
All full-fare coach tickets on Breezeway Airlines
cost the same in constant dollars as they did a
year ago.
The average number of coach passengers per
ﬂight that Breezeway Airlines carries from
Toronto to Dallas today is higher than the
average number per ﬂight a year ago.
The criteria that Breezeway Airlines uses for
permitting passengers to buy discount coach
tickets on the Toronto-to-Dallas route are
different today than they were a year ago.

Which one of the following principles underlies the
arbitrator’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A manager should take foreseeable problems
into account when making decisions.
A manager should be able to depend on
contractors to do their jobs promptly.
A manager should see to it that contractors do
their jobs promptly.
A manager should be held responsible for
mistakes made by those whom the manager
directly supervises.
A manager, and only a manager, should be held
responsible for a project’s failure.

Questions 21-22
21
Editorial: The government claims that the country’s
nuclear power plants are entirely safe and hence that
the public’s fear of nuclear accidents at these plants
is groundless. The government also contends that its
recent action to limit the nuclear industry’s ﬁnancial
liability in the case of nuclear accidents at power plants
is justiﬁed by the need to protect the nuclear industry
from the threat of bankruptcy. But even the government
says that unlimited liability poses such a threat only
if injury claims can be sustained against the industry;
and the government admits that for such claims to be
sustained, injury must result from a nuclear accident.
The public’s fear, therefore, is well founded.
21. If all of the statements offered in support of the
editorial’s conclusion correctly describe the
government’s position, which one of the following must
also be true on the basis of those statements?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The government’s claim about the safety of the
country’s nuclear power plants is false.
The government’s position on nuclear power
plants is inconsistent.
The government misrepresented its reasons for
acting to limit the nuclear industry’s liability.
Unlimited ﬁnancial liability in the case of
nuclear accidents poses no threat to the ﬁnancial
security of the country’s nuclear industry.
The only serious threat posed by a nuclear
accident would be to the ﬁnancial security of
the nuclear industry.

22. Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the editorial’s argumentation?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If the government claims that something is
unsafe then, in the absence of overwhelming
evidence to the contrary, that thing should be
assumed to be unsafe.
Fear that a certain kind of event will occur is
well founded if those who have control over
the occurrence of events of that kind stand to
beneﬁt ﬁnancially from such an occurrence.
If a potentially dangerous thing is safe only
because the ﬁnancial security of those
responsible for its operation depends on its
being safe, then eliminating that dependence is
not in the best interests of the public.
The government sometimes makes unsupported
claims about what situations will arise, but
it does not act to prevent a certain kind of
situation from arising unless there is a real
danger that such a situation will arise.
If a real ﬁnancial threat to a major industry
exists, then government action to limit that
threat is justiﬁed.

23. Linda says that, as a scientist, she knows that no
scientist appreciates poetry. And, since most scientists
are logical, at least some of the people who appreciate
poetry are illogical.
Which one of the following is most parallel in its
reasoning to the ﬂawed reasoning above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Ralph says that, as an expert in biology, he
knows that no marsupial lays eggs. And, since
most marsupials are native to Australia, at least
some of the animals native to Australia do not
lay eggs.
Franz says that, as a father of four children, he
knows that no father wants children to eat candy
at bedtime. And, since most fathers are adults,
at least some of the people who want children to
eat candy at bedtime are children.
Yun says that, as a wine connoisseur, he knows
that no wine aged in metal containers is equal
in quality to the best wine aged in oak. And,
since most California wine is aged in metal
containers, California wine is inferior to at least
the best French wine aged in oak.
Xi says that, as an experienced photographer,
she knows that no color ﬁlm produces images
as sharp as the best black-and-white ﬁlm. And,
since most instant ﬁlm is color ﬁlm, at least
some instant ﬁlm produces images less sharp
than the best black-and-white ﬁlm.
Betty says that, as a corporate executive, she
knows that no corporate executives like to pay
taxes. And, since most corporate executives are
honest people, at least some people who like to

24. Automobile-emission standards are enforced through
annual inspection. At those inspections cars are tested
while idling; that is, standing still with their engines
running. Testing devices measure the levels of various
pollutants as exhaust gases leave the tail pipe.
Which one of the following, if true, most strongly
indicates that current enforcement of automobileemission standards might be ineffective in controlling
overall pollutant levels?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

As an emission-control technology approaches
its limits, any additional gains in effectiveness
become progressively more expensive.
The testing devices used must be recalibrated
frequently to measure pollutant levels with
acceptable accuracy.
The adjustments needed to make a car idle
cleanly make it likely that the car will emit high
levels of pollutants when moving at highway
speeds.
Most car owners ask their mechanics to make
sure that their cars are in compliance with
emission standards.
When emission standards are set, no allowances
are made for elder cars.

25. The indigenous people of Tasmania are clearly related
to the indigenous people of Australia, but were
separated from them when the land bridge between
Australia and Tasmania disappeared approximately
10,000 years ago. Two thousand years after the
disappearance of the land bridge, however, there were
major differences between the culture and technology
of the indigenous Tasmanians and those of the
indigenous Australians. The indigenous Tasmanians,
unlike their Australian relatives, had no domesticated
dogs, ﬁshing nets, polished stone tools, or hunting
implements like the boomerang and the spear-thrower.
Each of the following, if true, would contribute to an
explanation of differences described above EXCEPT:
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

After the disappearance of the land bridge the
indigenous Tasmanians simply abandoned
certain practices and technologies that they had
originally shared with their Australian relatives.
Devices such as the spear-thrower and the
boomerang were developed by the indigenous
Tasmanians more than 10,000 years ago.
Technological innovations such as ﬁshing nets,
polished stone tools, and so on, were imported
to Australia by Polynesian explorers more
recently than 10,000 years ago.
Indigenous people of Australia developed
hunting implements like the boomerang and
the spear-thrower after the disappearance of the
land bridge.
Although the technological and cultural
innovations were developed in Australia more
than 10,000 years ago, they were developed by
groups in northern Australia with whom the
indigenous Tasmanians had no contact prior to
the disappearance of the land bridge.

For some years before the outbreak of World
War I, a number of painters in different European
countries developed works of art that some have
described as prophetic: paintings that by challenging
viewers’ habitual ways of perceiving the world of the
present are thus said to anticipate a future world that
would be very different. The artistic styles that they
brought into being varied widely, but all these styles
had in common a very important break with traditions
of representational art that stretched back to the
Renaissance.
So fundamental is this break with tradition that it is
not surprising to discover that these artistsamong
them Picasso and Braque in France, Kandinsky in
Germany, and Malevich in Russiaare often
credited with having anticipated not just subsequent
developments in the arts, but also the political and
social disruptions and upheavals of the modern world
that came into being during and after the war. One art
critic even goes so far as to claim that it is the
very prophetic power of these artworks, and not
their break with traditional artistic techniques, that
constitutes their chief interest and value.
No one will deny that an artist may, just as much as
a writer or a politician, speculate about the future
and then try to express a vision of that future through
making use of a particular style or choice of imagery;
speculation about the possibility of war in Europe
was certainly widespread during the early years of the
twentieth century. But the forward-looking quality
attributed to these artists should instead be credited to
their exceptional aesthetic innovations rather than to
any power to make clever guesses about political or
social trends. For example, the clear impression we get
of Picasso and Braque, the joint founders of cubism,
from their contemporaries as well as from later
statements made by the artists themselves, is that they
were primarily concerned with problems of
representation and form and with efforts to create a far
more “real” reality than the one that was accessible
only to the eye. The reformation of society was of no
interest to them as artists.
It is also important to remember that not all
decisive changes in art are quickly followed by
dramatic events in the world outside art. The case of
Delacroix, the nineteenth-century French painter, is
revealing. His stylistic innovations startled his
contemporariesand still retain that power over
modern viewersbut
but most art historians have decided

that Delacroix adjusted himself to new social

conditions that were already coming into being as a
result of political upheavals that had occurred in 1830,
as opposed to other artists who supposedly told of
changes still to come.

(E)

Although they ﬂourished independently, the
pre-World War I European painters who
developed new ways of looking at the world
shared a common desire to break with the
traditions of representational art.
The work of the pre-World War I European
painters who developed new ways of looking at
the world cannot be said to have intentionally
predicted social changes but only to have
anticipated new directions in artistic perception
and expression.
The work of the pre-World War I European
painters who developed new ways of looking at
the world was important for its ability to predict
social changes and its anticipation of new
directions in artistic expression.
Art critics who believe that the work of some
pre-World War I European painters foretold
imminent social changes are mistaken because
art is incapable of expressing a vision of the
future.
Art critics who believe that the work of some

Which one of the following most accurately describes
the contents of the passage?
(A)

The supposed innovations of Picasso, Braque,
Kandinsky, and Malevich were based on
stylistic discoveries that had been made in the
Renaissance but went unexplored for centuries.
The work of Picasso, Braque, Kandinsky, and
Malevich possessed prophetic power because
these artists employed the traditional techniques
of representational art with unusual skill.
The importance of the work of Picasso, Braque,
Kandinsky, and Malevich is due largely to the
fact that the work was stylistically ahead of its
time.
The prophecies embodied in the work of Picasso,
Braque, Kandinsky, and Malevich were shrewd
predictions based on insights into the European
political situation.
The artistic styles brought into being by
Picasso, Braque, Kandinsky, and Malevich,
while stylistically innovative, were of little

Tribal communities in North America believe that
their traditional languages are valuable resources that
must be maintained. However, these traditional
languages can fall into disuse when some of the effects
of the majority culture on tribal life serve as barriers
between a community and its traditional forms of
social, economic, or spiritual interaction. In some
communities the barrier has been overcome because
people have recognized that language loss is serious
and have taken action to prevent it, primarily through
community self-teaching.
Before any community can systematically and
formally teach a traditional language to its younger
members, it must ﬁrst document the language’s
grammar; for example, a group of Northern Utes spent
two years conducting a thorough analysis and
classiﬁcation of Northern Ute linguistic structures. The
grammatical information is then arranged in sequence
from the simpler to the more complex types of usage,
and methods are devised to present the sequence in
ways that will be most useful and appropriate to the
culture.
Certain obstacles can stand in the way of
developing these teaching methods. One is the
difﬁculty a community may encounter when it attempts
to write down elements (particularly the spellings of
words) of a language that has been primarily oral for
centuries, as is often the case with traditional
languages. Sometimes this difﬁculty can simply be a
matter of the lack of acceptable written equivalents for
certain sounds in the traditional language: problems
arise because of an insistence that every sound in the
language have a unique written equivalent
equivalenta desirable
but ultimately frustrating condition that no written
language has ever fully satisﬁed.
Another obstacle is dialect. There may be many
language traditions in a particular community; which
one is to be written down and taught? The Northern
Utes decided not to standardize their language,
agreeing that various phonetic spellings of words
would be accepted as long as their meanings were
clear. Although this troubled some community
members who favored Western notions of standard
language writing or whose training in Western-style
linguistics was especially rigid, the lack of standard
orthography made sense in the context of the
community’s needs. Within a year after the adoption
of instruction in the Northern Ute language, even
elementary school children could write and speak it
effectively.
It has been argued that the attempt to write down
traditional languages is misguided and unnecessary;
after all, in many cases these languages have been
transmitted in their oral form since their origins.
Defenders of the practice counter that they are writing
down their languages precisely because of a general
decline in oral traditions, but they concede that
languages could be preserved in their oral form if a
community made every effort to eschew aspects of the
majority culture that make this preservation difﬁcult.

In the face of the pervasive inﬂuences of the
majority culture, some tribes are having
difﬁculty teaching their traditional languages to
younger tribe members.
If tribes are to continue to hold on to their
cultures in the face of majority culture
inﬂuences, it is necessary for them to ﬁrst teach
their traditional languages to younger tribe
members.
Responding to doubts about the value of
preserving oral forms of culture, some tribes,
using techniques of Western-style linguistics,
have taught their traditional languages to
younger tribe members.
Recognizing the value of their traditional
languages, some tribes, despite the difﬁculties
involved, have developed programs to teach
their traditional languages to younger tribe
members.
Sidestepping the inherent contradiction of
preserving oral forms of culture in writing,
some tribes are attempting, eschewing the
inﬂuences of the majority culture, to teach their
traditional languages to younger tribe members.

According to the passage, the ﬁrst step in preparing to
formally teach a traditional language is to
(A)
(B)

(D)

(E)

In writing down an oral language, one should
always be concerned primarily with the degree
of correspondence between spoken sounds and
written symbols.
In deciding whether and how to standardize and
teach a primarily oral language, one should
always keep the needs of the community and the
culture foremost.
In determining whether to preserve a language
orally or preserve it in writing, one should
always strive to ignore the inﬂuences of the
majority culture and focus on which method is
most effective.
In considering how to present the grammar of a
primarily oral language to students, one should
always employ a sequence that tackles more
difﬁcult concepts ﬁrst.
In adjudicating among variant spellings of words
from different language traditions, one should
always favor the spelling preferred by the
majority of the community.

Scientists have long known that the soft surface of
the bill of the platypus is perforated with openings that
contain sensitive nerve endings. Only recently,
however, have biologists concluded on the basis of new
evidence that the animal uses its bill to locate its prey
while underwater, a conclusion suggested by the fact
that the animal’s eyes, ears, and nostrils are sealed
when it is submerged. The new evidence comes from
neurophysiological studies, which have recently
revealed that within the pores on the bill there are two
kinds of sensory receptors: mechanoreceptors, which
are tiny pushrods that respond to tactile pressure, and
electroreceptors, which respond to weak electrical
ﬁelds. Having discovered that tactile stimulation of the
pushrods sends nerve impulses to the brain, where they
evoke an electric potential over an area of the
neocortex much larger than the one stimulated by input
from the limbs, eyes, and ears, Bohringer concluded
that the bill must be the primary sensory organ for the
platypus. Her ﬁnding was supported by studies
showing that the bill is extraordinarily sensitive to
tactile stimulation: stimulation with a ﬁne glass stylus
sent a signal by way of the ﬁfth cranial nerve to the
neocortex and from there to the motor cortex.
Presumably nerve impulses from the motor cortex
then induced a snapping movement of the bill. But
Bohringer’s investigations did not explain how the
animal locates its prey at a distance.
Scheich’s neurophysiological studies contribute to
solving this mystery. His initial work showed that
when a platypus feeds, it swims along, steadily
wagging its bill from side to side until prey is
encountered. It thereupon switches to searching
behavior, characterized by erratic movements of the
bill over a small area at the bottom of a body of water,
which is followed by homing in on the object and
seizing it. In order to determine how the animal senses
prey and then distinguishes it from other objects on the
bottom, Scheich hypothesized that a sensory system
based on electroreception similar to that found in
sharks might exist in the platypus. In further
experiments he found he could trigger the switch from
patrolling to searching behavior in the platypus by
creating a dipole electric ﬁeld in the water with the aid
of a small 1.5-volt battery. The platypus, sensitive to
the weak electric current that was created, rapidly
oriented toward the battery at a distance of
10 centimeters and sometimes as much as
30 centimeters. Once the battery was detected, the
platypus would inevitably attack it as if it were food.
Scheich then discovered that the tail ﬂicks of
freshwater shrimp, a common prey of the platypus,
also produce weak electric ﬁelds and elicit an identical
response. Scheich and his colleagues believe that it is
reasonable to assume that all the invertebrates on
which the platypus feeds must produce electric ﬁelds.

Until about 1970, anyone who wanted to write a
comprehensive history of medieval English law as it
actually affected women would have found a dearth of
published books or articles concerned with speciﬁc
legal topics relating to women and derived from
extensive research in actual court records. This is a
serious deﬁciency, since court records are of vital
importance in discovering how the law actually
affected women, as opposed to how the law was
intended to affect them or thought to affect them.
These latter questions can be answered by consulting
such sources as treatises, commentaries, and statutes;
such texts were what most scholars of the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries concentrated on whenever
they did write about medieval law. But these sources
are of little help in determining, for example, how often
women’s special statutory privileges were thwarted by
intimidation or harassment, or how often women
managed to evade special statutory limitations. And,
quite apart from provisions designed to apply only, or
especially, to women, they cannot tell us how general
law affected the female half of the population
population
how
how
women defendants and plaintiffs were treated in the
courts in practice when they tried to exercise the rights
they shared with men. Only quantitative studies of
large numbers of cases would allow even a guess at the
answers to these questions, and this scholarly work has
been attempted by few.
One can easily imagine why. Most medieval
English court records are written in Latin or AngloNorman French and have never been published. The
sheer volume of material to be sifted is daunting: there
are over 27,500 parchment pages in the common plea
rolls of the thirteenth century alone, every page nearly
three feet long, and written often front and back in
highly stylized court hand. But the difﬁculty of the
sources, while it might appear to explain why the
relevant scholarship has not been undertaken, seems
actually to have deterred few: the fact is that few
historians have wanted to write anything approaching
women’s legal history in the ﬁrst place. Most modern
legal historians who have written on one aspect or
another of special laws pertaining to women have
begun with an interest in a legal idea or event or
institution, not with a concern for how it affected
women. Very few legal historians have started with an
interest in women’s history that they might have
elected to pursue through various areas of general law.
And the result of all this is that the current state of our
scholarly knowledge relating to law and the medieval
Englishwoman is still fragmentary at best, though the
situation is slowly improving.

of modern legal institutions and ideas.
They provide relatively little information relevant

history should be deﬁned as the study of laws
that apply only, or especially, to women
the relative scarcity of studies providing a

25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet..
1.

Combustion of gasoline in automobile engines produces
benzene, a known carcinogen. Environmentalists
propose replacing gasoline with methanol, which does
not produce signiﬁcant quantities of benzene when
burned. However, combustion of methanol produces
formaldehyde, also a known carcinogen. Therefore the
environmentalists’ proposal has little merit.
Which one of the following, if true, most supports the
environmentalists’ proposal?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

2.

The engines of some automobiles now on the
road burn diesel fuel rather than gasoline.
Several large research efforts are under way to
formulate cleaner-burning types of gasoline.
In some regions, the local economy is largely
dependent on industries devoted to the
production and distribution of automobile fuel.
Formaldehyde is a less potent carcinogen than
benzene.
Since methanol is water soluble, methanol spills
are more damaging to the environment than
gasoline spills.

Economist: To the extent that homelessness arises
from a lack of available housing, it should not
be assumed that the proﬁt motive is at fault.
Private investors will, in general, provide housing
if the market allows them to make a proﬁt; it is
unrealistic to expect investors to take risks with
their property unless they get some beneﬁt in
return.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the economist’s argument by the
phrase “To the extent that homelessness arises from a
lack of available housing”?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It limits the application of the argument to a part
of the problem.
It suggests that the primary cause of
homelessness is lack of available housing.
It is offered as evidence crucial to the conclusion.
It expresses the conclusion to be argued for.
It suggests a possible solution to the problem of
homelessness.

3.

Physical education should teach people to pursue
healthy, active lifestyles as they grow older. But the
focus on competitive sports in most schools causes
most of the less competitive students to turn away
from sports. Having learned to think of themselves as
unathletic, they do not exercise enough to stay healthy.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the statements above, if they are true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Physical education should include
noncompetitive activities.
Competition causes most students to turn away
from sports.
People who are talented at competitive physical
endeavors exercise regularly.
The mental aspects of exercise are as important
as the physical ones.
Children should be taught the dangers of a
sedentary lifestyle.

Questions 4-5
Political opinion and analysis outside the mainstream
rarely are found on television talk shows, and it might
be thought that this state of affairs is a product of the
political agenda of the television stations themselves. In
fact, television stations are driven by the same economic
forces as sellers of more tangible goods. Because they must
attempt to capture the largest possible share of the television
audience for their shows, they air only those shows that
will appeal to large numbers of people. As a result, political
opinions and analyses aired on television talk shows are
typically bland and innocuous.
4.

6.

Which one of the following sentences most accurately
expresses the main point of the passage?
(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

most television viewers cannot agree on which
elements of a particular opinion or analysis are
most disturbing
there are television viewers who might refuse
to watch television talk shows that they knew
would be controversial and disturbing
each television viewer holds some opinion that
is outside the political mainstream, but those
opinions are not the same for everyone
there are television shows on which economic
forces have an even greater impact than they do
on television talk shows
the television talk shows of different stations
resemble one another in most respects

The explanation offered by the author of the passage
makes the assumption that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

television station executives usually lack a
political agenda of their own
bland and innocuous political opinions and
analyses are generally in the mainstream
political analysts outside the mainstream are
relatively indifferent to the effect their analyses
have on television viewers
most television viewers are prepared to argue
against allowing the expression of political
opinions and analyses with which they disagree
the political opinions of television station
executives are not often reﬂected in the
television shows their stations produce

Some judges complain about statutes that specify
mandatory minimum sentences for criminal offenses.
These legal restrictions, they complain, are too
mechanical and prevent judges from deciding when
a given individual can or cannot be rehabilitated. But
that is precisely why mandatory minimum sentences
are necessary. History amply demonstrates that
when people are free to use their own judgment they
invariably believe themselves to act wisely when in
fact they are often arbitrary and irrational. There is no
reason to think that judges are an exception to this rule.

An assumption made in the explanation offered by the
author of the passage is that

(B)

5.

4

(C)
(D)
(E)

People believe that they have good judgment but
never do.
Mandatory minimum sentences are too
mechanical and reduce judicial discretion.
Judges should be free to exercise their own
judgment.
Judges are often arbitrary and irrational.
Mandatory minimum sentences are needed to
help prevent judicial arbitrariness.

Questions 7-8

Conservationist: The population of a certain wildﬂower
is so small that the species is headed for extinction.
However, this wildﬂower can cross-pollinate with
a closely related domesticated daisy, producing
viable seeds. Such cross-pollination could result in
a signiﬁcant population of wildﬂower-daisy hybrids.
The daisy should therefore be introduced into the
wildﬂower’s range, since although the hybrid would
differ markedly from the wildﬂower, hybridization
is the only means of preventing total loss of the
wildﬂower in its range.
7.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the conservationist’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

8.

It is better to take measures to preserve a valued
type of organism, even if those measures are
drastic, than to accept a less valuable substitute
for the organism.
It is better to preserve a type of organism that
is in danger of extinction, even if surviving
organisms of that type are not vigorous, than to
allow something more vigorous to replace it.
It is better to change a type of organism that
would otherwise be lost, even if the changes are
radical, than to lose it entirely.
It is better to destroy one of two competing types
of organisms, even if both are irreplaceable,
than to allow both of them to be lost.
It is better to protect an endangered type of
organism, even if doing so has some negative
effects on another type of organism, than to do
nothing at all.

Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the conservationist’s reasoning depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The wildﬂower currently reproduces only by
forming seeds.
The domesticated daisy was bred from wild
plants that once grew in the wildﬂower’s range.
Increasing the population of the wildﬂower will
also expand its range.
Wildﬂower-daisy hybrids will be able to
reproduce.
The domesticated daisy will cross-pollinate with
any daisylike plant.

Because of increases in the price of oil and because of
government policies promoting energy conservation,
the use of oil to heat homes fell by 40 percent from
1970 to the present, and many homeowners switched
to natural gas for heating. Because switching to natural
gas involved investing in equipment, a signiﬁcant
switch back to oil in the near future is unlikely.
The prediction that ends the passage would be most
seriously called into question if it were true that in the
last few years
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

the price of natural gas to heat homes has
remained constant, while the cost of equipment
to heat homes with natural gas has fallen
sharply
the price of home heating oil has remained
constant, while the cost of equipment to heat
homes with natural gas has risen sharply
the cost of equipment to heat homes with natural
gas has fallen sharply, while the price of home
heating oil has fallen to 1970 levels
the cost of equipment to heat homes with oil has
fallen sharply, while the price of heating with
oil has fallen below the price of heating with
natural gas
the use of oil to heat homes has continued to
decline, while the price of heating oil has fallen
to 1970 levels

10. Parents should not necessarily raise their children in the
ways experts recommend, even if some of those experts
are themselves parents. After all, parents are the ones
who directly experience which methods are successful
in raising their own children.
Which one of the following most closely conforms to
the principle that the passage above illustrates?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Although music theory is intrinsically interesting
and may be helpful to certain musicians, it does
not distinguish good music from bad: that is a
matter of taste and not of theory.
One need not pay much attention to the advice of
automotive experts when buying a car if those
experts are not interested in the mundane factors
that concern the average consumer.
In deciding the best way to proceed, a climber
familiar with a mountain might do well to
ignore the advice of mountain climbing experts
unfamiliar with that mountain.
A typical farmer is less likely to know what types
of soil are most productive than is someone with
an advanced degree in agricultural science.
Unlike society, one’s own conscience speaks
with a single voice; it is better to follow the
advice of one’s own conscience than the advice
of society.

11. Sometimes when their trainer gives the hand signal
for “Do something creative together,” two dolphins
circle a pool in tandem and then leap through the air
simultaneously. On other occasions the same signal
elicits synchronized backward swims or tail-waving.
These behaviors are not simply learned responses
to a given stimulus. Rather, dolphins are capable of
higher cognitive functions that may include the use of
language and forethought.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Mammals have some resemblance to one another
with respect to bodily function and brain
structure.
The dolphins often exhibit complex new
responses to the hand signal.
The dolphins are given food incentives as part of
their training.
Dolphins do not interact with humans the way
they interact with one another.
Some of the behaviors mentioned are exhibited
by dolphins in their natural habitat.

12. Editorialist: Drivers with a large number of demerit
points who additionally have been convicted of
a serious driving-related offense should either be
sentenced to jail or be forced to receive driver reeducation, since to do otherwise would be to allow
a crime to go unpunished. Only if such drivers are
likely to be made more responsible drivers should
driver re-education be recommended for them.
Unfortunately, it is always almost impossible
to make drivers with a large number of demerit
points more responsible drivers.
If the editorialist’s statements are true, they provide the
most support for which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Drivers with a large number of demerit
points who have been convicted of a serious
driving-related offense should be sent to jail.
Driver re-education offers the best chance of
making drivers with a large number of demerit
points responsible drivers.
Driver re-education is not a harsh enough
punishment for anyone convicted of a
serious driving-related offense who has also
accumulated a large number of demerit points.
Driver re-education should not be recommended
for those who have committed no serious
driving-related offenses.
Drivers with a large number of demerit points
but no conviction for a serious driving-related
offense should receive driver re-education rather
than jail.

Questions 13-14

Plant manager: We could greatly reduce the amount of
sulfur dioxide our copper-smelting plant releases
into the atmosphere by using a new process. The new
process requires replacing our open furnaces with
closed ones and moving the copper from one furnace to
the next in solid, not molten, form. However, not only
is the new equipment expensive to buy and install, but
the new process also costs more to run than the current
process, because the copper must be reheated after it
has cooled. So overall, adopting the new process will
cost much but bring the company no proﬁt.
Supervisor: I agree with your overall conclusion, but
disagree about one point you make, since the latest
closed furnaces are extremely fuel-efﬁcient.
13. The point about which the supervisor expresses
disagreement with the plant manager is
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

whether the new copper-smelting process
releases less sulfur dioxide gas into the
atmosphere than the current process
whether the new copper-smelting process is more
expensive to run than the current process
whether the new process should be adopted in
the copper-smelting plant
whether closed copper-smelting furnaces are
more fuel-efﬁcient than open furnaces
whether cooling and reheating the copper will
cost more than moving it in molten form

14. The plant manager’s argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on which one of the following grounds?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The overall conclusion is about a net effect but is
based solely on evidence about only some of the
factors that contribute to the effect.
The support for the overall conclusion is the
authority of the plant manager rather than any
independently veriﬁable evidence.
The overall conclusion reached merely repeats
the evidence offered.
Evidence that is taken to be only probably true is
used as the basis for a claim that something is
deﬁnitely true.
Facts that are not directly relevant to the
argument are treated as if they supported the
overall conclusion.

15. Ambiguity inspires interpretation. The saying “We
are the measure of all things,” for instance, has been
interpreted by some people to imply that humans are
centrally important in the universe, while others have
interpreted it to mean simply that, since all knowledge
is human knowledge, humans must rely on themselves
to ﬁnd the truth.
The claim that ambiguity inspires interpretation ﬁgures
in the argument in which one of the following ways?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is used to support the argument’s conclusion.
It is an illustration of the claim that we are the
measure of all things.
It is compatible with either accepting or rejecting
the argument’s conclusion.
It is a view that other statements in the argument
are intended to support.
It sets out a difﬁculty the argument is intended to
solve.

16. Franklin: It is inconsistent to pay sports celebrities ten
times what Nobel laureates are paid. Both have
rare talents and work hard.
Tomeka: What you’ve neglected to consider is that
unlike Nobel laureates, sports celebrities earn
millions of dollars for their employers in the form
of gate receipts and TV rights.

17. Studies of the reliability of eyewitness identiﬁcations
show little correlation between the accuracy of a
witness’s account and the conﬁdence the witness has in
the account. Certain factors can increase or undermine
a witness’s conﬁdence without altering the accuracy of
the identiﬁcation. Therefore, police ofﬁcers are advised
to disallow suspect lineups in which witnesses can hear
one another identifying suspects.
Which one of the following is a principle underlying the
advice given to police ofﬁcers?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

The conﬁdence people have in what they
remember having seen is affected by their
awareness of what other people claim to have
seen.
Unless an eyewitness is confronted with more
than one suspect at a time, the accuracy of his or
her statements cannot be trusted.
If several eyewitnesses all identify the same
suspect in a lineup, it is more likely that the
suspect committed the crime than if only one
eyewitness identiﬁes the suspect.
Police ofﬁcers are more interested in the
conﬁdence witnesses have when testifying than
in the accuracy of that testimony.
The accuracy of an eyewitness account is
doubtful if the eyewitness contradicts what
other eyewitnesses claim to have seen.

Franklin’s and Tomeka’s statements provide the most
support for holding that they disagree about the truth of
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Nobel laureates should be taken more seriously.
Nobel laureates should be paid more than sports
celebrities.
Sports celebrities and Nobel laureates work
equally hard for their employers.
There is no rational basis for the salary
difference between sports celebrities and Nobel
laureates.
The social contributions made by sports
celebrities should be greater than they currently
are.

18. All actions are motivated by self-interest, since any
action that is apparently altruistic can be described in
terms of self-interest. For example, helping someone
can be described in terms of self-interest: the motivation
is hope for a reward or other personal beneﬁt to be
bestowed as a result of the helping action.

The term “self-interest” is allowed to shift in
meaning over the course of the argument.
The argument takes evidence showing merely
that its conclusion could be true to constitute
evidence showing that the conclusion is in fact
true.
The argument does not explain what is meant by
“reward” and “personal beneﬁt.”
The argument ignores the possibility that what is
taken to be necessary for a certain interest to be
a motivation actually sufﬁces to show that that
interest is a motivation.
The argument depends for its appeal only on the
emotional content of the example cited.

19. In the decade from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s,
large corporations were rocked by mergers,
reengineering, and downsizing. These events
signiﬁcantly undermined employees’ job security.
Surprisingly, however, employees’ perception of their
own job security hardly changed over that period.
Fifty-eight percent of employees surveyed in 1984 and
55 percent surveyed in 1994 stated that their own jobs
were very secure.
Each of the following contributes to an explanation of
the surprising survey results described above EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A large number of the people in both surveys
work in small companies that were not affected
by mergers, reengineering, and downsizing.
Employees who feel secure in their jobs tend to
think that the jobs of others are secure.
The corporate downsizing that took place during
this period had been widely anticipated for
several years before the mid-1980s.
Most of the major downsizing during this period
was completed within a year after the ﬁrst
survey.
In the mid-1990s, people were generally more
optimistic about their lives, even in the face of
hardship, than they were a decade before.

20. Amphibian populations are declining in numbers
worldwide. Not coincidentally, the earth’s ozone layer
has been continuously depleted throughout the last
50 years. Atmospheric ozone blocks UV-B, a type
of ultraviolet radiation that is continuously produced
by the sun, and which can damage genes. Because
amphibians lack hair, hide, or feathers to shield them,
they are particularly vulnerable to UV-B radiation. In
addition, their gelatinous eggs lack the protection of
leathery or hard shells. Thus, the primary cause of the
declining amphibian population is the depletion of the
ozone layer.
Each of the following, if true, would strengthen the
argument EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Of the various types of radiation blocked by
atmospheric ozone, UV-B is the only type that
can damage genes.
Amphibian populations are declining far
more rapidly than are the populations of
nonamphibian species whose tissues and eggs
have more natural protection from UV-B.
Atmospheric ozone has been signiﬁcantly
depleted above all the areas of the world in
which amphibian populations are declining.
The natural habitat of amphibians has not
become smaller over the past century.
Amphibian populations have declined
continuously for the last 50 years.

21. All too many weaklings are also cowards, and few
cowards fail to be fools. Thus there must be at least one
person who is both a weakling and a fool.
The ﬂawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above
is most similar to that in which one of the following?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

All weasels are carnivores and no carnivores
fail to be nonherbivores, so some weasels are
nonherbivores.
Few moralists have the courage to act according
to the principles they profess, and few saints
have the ability to articulate the principles by
which they live, so it follows that few people
can both act like saints and speak like moralists.
Some painters are dancers, since some painters
are musicians, and some musicians are dancers.
If an act is virtuous, then it is autonomous, for
acts are not virtuous unless they are free, and
acts are not free unless they are autonomous.
A majority of the voting population favors a
total ban, but no one who favors a total ban is
opposed to stiffer tariffs, so at least one voter is
not opposed to stiffer tariffs.

22. Critic: Most chorale preludes were written for the
organ, and most great chorale preludes written
for the organ were written by J. S. Bach. One of
Bach’s chorale preludes dramatizes one hymn’s
perspective on the year’s end. This prelude is
agonizing and ﬁxed on the passing of the old year,
with its dashed hopes and lost opportunities. It
does not necessarily reveal Bach’s own attitude
toward the change of the year, but does reﬂect
the tone of the hymn’s text. People often think
that artists create in order to express their own
feelings. Some artists do. Master artists never do,
and Bach was a master artist.
If the critic’s statements are true, then on the basis of
them which one of the following CANNOT be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Bach believed that the close of the year was not a
time for optimism and joyous celebration.
In composing music about a particular subject,
Bach did not write the music in order to express
his own attitude toward the subject.
In compositions other than chorale preludes,
Bach wrote music in order to express his
feelings toward various subjects.
Most of Bach’s chorale preludes were written for
instruments other than the organ.
Most of the great chorale preludes were written
for instruments other than the organ.

23. Quasarscelestial objects so far away that their light
takes at least 500 million years to reach Earthhave
been seen since 1963. For anything that far away to
appear from Earth the way quasars do, it would have to
burn steadily at a rate that produces more light than 90
billion suns would produce. But nothing that burns at a
rate that produces that much light could exist for more
than about 100 million years.
If the statements above are true, which one of the
following must also be true on the basis of them?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Instruments in use before 1963 were not sensitive
enough to permit quasars to be seen.
Light from quasars ﬁrst began reaching Earth in
1963.
Anything that from Earth appears as bright as
a quasar does must produce more light than
would be produced by 90 billion suns.
Nothing that is as far from Earth as quasars are
can continue to exist for more than about 100
million years.
No quasar that has ever been seen from Earth
exists any longer.

24. Medical researcher: As expected, records covering
the last four years of ten major hospitals indicate
that babies born prematurely were more likely to
have low birth weights and to suffer from health
problems than were babies not born prematurely.
These records also indicate that mothers who had
received adequate prenatal care were less likely to
have low birth weight babies than were mothers
who had received inadequate prenatal care.
Adequate prenatal care, therefore, signiﬁcantly
decreases the risk of low birth weight babies.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
medical researcher’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

The hospital records indicate that many babies
that are born with normal birth weights are born
to mothers who had inadequate prenatal care.
Mothers giving birth prematurely are routinely
classiﬁed by hospitals as having received
inadequate prenatal care when the record of that
care is not available.
The hospital records indicate that low birth
weight babies were routinely classiﬁed as
having been born prematurely.
Some babies not born prematurely, whose
mothers received adequate prenatal care, have
low birth weights.
Women who receive adequate prenatal care are
less likely to give birth prematurely than are
women who do not receive adequate prenatal
care.

25. Formal performance evaluations in the professional
world are conducted using realistic situations.
Physicians are allowed to consult medical texts freely,
attorneys may refer to law books and case records, and
physicists and engineers have their manuals at hand
for ready reference. Students, then, should likewise
have access to their textbooks whenever they take
examinations.
The reasoning in the argument is questionable because
the argument
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

cites examples that are insufﬁcient to support the
generalization that performance evaluations in
the professional world are conducted in realistic
situations
fails to consider the possibility that adopting its
recommendation will not signiﬁcantly increase
most students’ test scores
neglects to take into account the fact that
professionals were once students who also
did not have access to textbooks during
examinations
neglects to take into account the fact that, unlike
students, professionals have devoted many years
of study to one subject
fails to consider the possibility that the purposes
of evaluation in the professional world and in
school situations are quite dissimilar
