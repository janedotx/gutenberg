SECTION I
Time—35 minutes
26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1.

A student has taken twelve courses and received a B in
a majority of them. The student is now taking another
course and will probably, given her record, receive a B
in it.

3.

For any given ticket in a 1000-ticket lottery, it is
reasonable to believe that that ticket will lose. Hence, it
is reasonable to believe that no ticket will win.

Each of the following, if true, strengthens the argument
EXCEPT:

Which one of the following exhibits ﬂawed reasoning
most similar to the ﬂawed reasoning in the argument
above?

(A)

(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The student previously studied alone but is
receiving help from several outstanding students
during the present course.
The twelve courses together covered a broad
range of subject matter.
The student previously studied in the library and
continues to do so.
The student received a B in all but one of the
twelve courses.
The current course is a continuation of one of the
twelve courses in which the student received a
B.

(B)

(C)
(D)

2.

If the government increases its funding for civilian
scientiﬁc research, private patrons and industries will
believe that such research has become primarily the
government’s responsibility. When they believe that
research is no longer primarily their responsibility,
private patrons and industries will decrease their
contributions toward research. Therefore, in order to
keep from depressing the overall level of funding for
civilian scientiﬁc research, the government should not
increase its own funding.

(E)

It is reasonable to believe for any randomly
drawn playing card that it will not be an ace, so
it is reasonable to believe that an ace will never
be drawn.
When the chances of a certain horse winning
the race are 999 out of 1000, it is reasonable
to believe that that horse will win. So it is
reasonable to believe that no one other than that
horse can win.
It is unreasonable to believe that 1000
consecutive coin ﬂips will turn up heads, so it is
reasonable to believe that this never happens.
It is reasonable to believe that if the most recent
ﬂip of a given coin was tails, the next ﬂip will
be heads. So if a coin has turned up tails the
last 1000 times it was ﬂipped, it is reasonable to
believe that it will turn up heads the next time it
is ﬂipped.
For any given group of ﬁve-year-old children, the
average height is one meter, so it is reasonable
to believe that if Pat is ﬁve years old, she is
exactly one meter tall.

Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument relies?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Governments should bear the majority of the
ﬁnancial burden of funding for civilian scientiﬁc
research.
Any increase in government funding would
displace more private funding for civilian
scientiﬁc research than it would provide.
Private donations toward research are no longer
welcomed by researchers whose work receives
government funding.
Civilian scientiﬁc research cannot be conducted
efﬁciently with more than one source of
funding.
Funding for civilian scientiﬁc research is
currently at the highest possible level.

4.

Dental researcher: Filling a cavity in a tooth is not a
harmless procedure: it inevitably damages some of
the healthy parts of the tooth. Cavities are harmful
only if the decay reaches the nerves inside the
tooth, and many cavities, if left untreated, never
progress to that point. Therefore, dentists should
not ﬁll a cavity unless the nerves inside the tooth
are in imminent danger from that cavity.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
strongly supports the researcher’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

5.

Dentists should perform any procedure that is
likely to be beneﬁcial in the long term, but
only if the procedure does not cause immediate
damage.
Dentists should help their patients to prevent
cavities rather than waiting until cavities are
present to begin treatment.
A condition that is only potentially harmful
should not be treated using a method that is
deﬁnitely harmful.
A condition that is typically progressive should
not be treated using methods that provide only
temporary relief.
A condition that is potentially harmful should
not be left untreated unless it can be kept under
constant surveillance.

Questions 6-7
Hospital auditor: The Rodriguez family stipulated that
the funds they donated to the neurological clinic all
be used to minimize patients’ suffering. The clinic
administration is clearly violating those terms, since
it has allocated nearly one ﬁfth of those funds for
research into new diagnostic technologies, instead of
letting that money ﬂow directly to its patients.
Clinic administrator: But the successful development of
new technologies will allow early diagnosis of many
neurological disorders. In most cases, patients who are
treated in the early stages of neurological disorders
suffer far less than do patients who are not treated until
their neurological disorders reach advanced stages.
6.

Which one of the following is the main point at
issue between the hospital auditor and the clinic
administrator?
(A)

(B)

The number of codﬁsh in the North Atlantic has
declined substantially as the population of harp seals
has increased from two million to more than three
million. Some blame the seal for the shrinking cod
population, but cod plays a negligible role in the seal’s
diet. It is therefore unlikely that the increase in the seal
population has contributed signiﬁcantly to the decline in
the cod population.

(C)
(D)

(E)

Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

People who ﬁsh for cod commercially are
inconvenienced by the presence of large
numbers of seals near traditional ﬁshing
grounds.
Water pollution poses a more serious threat to
cod than to the harp seal.
The harp seal thrives in water that is too cold to
support a dense population of cod.
Cod feed almost exclusively on capelin, a ﬁsh
that is a staple of the harp seal’s diet.
The cod population in the North Atlantic began
to decline before the harp-seal population began
to increase.

7.

whether early treatment of many neurological
disorders lessens the suffering associated
with those disorders rather than completely
eliminating such suffering
whether the patients being treated at the
neurological clinic are currently receiving
adequate treatment for the neurological
disorders from which they suffer
whether the Rodriguez family clearly stipulated
that the funds they donated to the neurological
clinic be used to minimize patients’ suffering
whether the neurological clinic is adhering
strictly to the conditions the Rodriguez family
placed on the allocation of the funds they
donated to the clinic
whether the Rodriguez family anticipated
that some of the funds they donated to the
neurological clinic would be used to pay for
research into new diagnostic technologies

The clinic administrator responds to the hospital auditor
by doing which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

demonstrating that the hospital auditor’s
conclusion, though broadly correct, stands in
need of a minor qualiﬁcation
showing that the hospital auditor’s argument fails
to separate what is the case from what ought to
be the case
reminding the hospital auditor that, in the case
at issue, being told what to do is tantamount to
being told how to do it
arguing that, in assessing the severity of a
violation, the reasoning motivating the violation
needs to be considered
reinterpreting a key phrase in the hospital
auditor’s argument so as to undermine an
assumption underlying that argument

8.

Generally speaking, if the same crop is sown in a ﬁeld
for several successive years, growth in the later years is
poorer than growth in the earlier years, since nitrogen
in the soil becomes depleted. Even though alfalfa is a
nitrogen-ﬁxing plant and thus increases the amount of
nitrogen in the soil, surprisingly, it too, if planted in the
same ﬁeld year after year, grows less well in the later
years than it does in the earlier years.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the similarity described above between alfalfa
and non-nitrogen-ﬁxing plants?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

9.

Some kinds of plants grow more rapidly and are
more productive when they are grown among
other kinds of plants rather than being grown
only among plants of their own kind.
Alfalfa increases the amount of nitrogen in
the soil by taking nitrogen from the air and
releasing it in a form that is usable by most
kinds of plants.
Certain types of plants, including alfalfa, produce
substances that accumulate in the soil and
that are toxic to the plants that produce those
substances.
Alfalfa increases nitrogen in the soil in which it
grows only if a certain type of soil bacteria is
present in the soil.
Alfalfa is very sensitive to juglone, a compound
that is exuded from the leaves of black walnut
trees.

Political commentators see recent policies of the
government toward Country X as appeasement, pure
and simple. This view is fundamentally mistaken, for
polls show that most people disagree with the political
commentators’ assessment of government policies
toward Country X.
The reasoning in the argument is questionable because
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the term “policies” is used ambiguously in the
argument
the political commentators discussed in the
passage are not identiﬁed
a claim is inferred to be false merely because a
majority of people believe it to be false
the claim that the political commentators are
mistaken is both a premise and a conclusion in
the argument
it is assumed that what is true of persons
individually is true of a country as a whole

10. It is a principle of economics that a nation can
experience economic growth only when consumer
conﬁdence is balanced with a small amount of
consumer skepticism.
Which one of the following is an application of the
economic principle above?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Any nation in which consumer conﬁdence is
balanced with a small amount of consumer
skepticism will experience economic growth.
Any nation in which the prevailing attitude of
consumers is not skepticism will experience
economic growth.
Any nation in which the prevailing attitude of
consumers is either exclusively conﬁdence
or exclusively skepticism will experience
economic growth.
Any nation in which the prevailing attitude of
consumers is exclusively conﬁdence will not
experience economic growth.
Any nation in which consumer skepticism is
balanced with a small amount of consumer
conﬁdence will experience economic growth.

11. Sharks have a higher ratio of cartilage mass to body
mass than any other organism. They also have a greater
resistance to cancer than any other organism. Shark
cartilage contains a substance that inhibits tumor
growth by stopping the development of a new blood
network. In the past 20 years, none of the responses
among terminal cancer patients to various therapeutic
measures has been more positive than the response
among those who consumed shark cartilage.
If the claims made above are true, then each of the
following could be true EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

No organism resists cancer better than sharks do,
but some resist cancer as well as sharks.
The organism most susceptible to cancer has
a higher percentage of cartilage than some
organisms that are less susceptible to cancer.
The substance in shark cartilage that inhibits
tumor growth is found in most organisms.
In the past 20 years many terminal cancer
patients have improved dramatically following
many sorts of therapy.
Some organisms have immune systems more
efﬁcient than a shark’s immune system.

Questions 12-13
People who say that Dooney County is ﬂat are clearly
wrong. On ﬂat land, soil erosion by water is not a problem.
Consequently, farmers whose land is ﬂat do not build
terraces to prevent erosion. Yet I hear that the farms in
Dooney County are dotted with terraces.
12. The author’s conclusion in the passage depends on the
assumption that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the only cause of soil erosion is water
there are terraces on farmland in Dooney County
which were built to prevent soil erosion
terraces of the kind found on farmland in Dooney
County have been shown to prevent soil erosion
on ﬂat land there is no soil erosion
the only terraces in Dooney County are on
farmland

13. The reasoning in the passage is most similar to that in
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

If we paint the room white, it will get smudged,
and we will have to paint it again soon.
Therefore, we should paint it dark blue.
People with children need more space than those
without children. Yet people with no children
can usually afford bigger houses.
People who get a lot of exercise have no trouble
falling asleep; hence, people who get a lot of
exercise do not use medication to help them fall
asleep. Jack is taking many kinds of medication,
so he must not be getting a lot of exercise.
If I go grocery shopping when I am hungry, I
buy snack foods and cannot resist eating them.
Therefore, I cannot lose weight.
People who have many friends tend to go out
often, so they need cars. Therefore, if Joe wants
to have many friends, he must buy a car.

14. The axis of Earth’s daily rotation is tilted with respect
to the plane of its orbit at an angle of roughly 23
degrees. That angle can be kept fairly stable only by the
gravitational inﬂuence of Earth’s large, nearby Moon.
Without such a stable and moderate axis tilt, a planet’s
climate is too extreme and unstable to support life.
Mars, for example, has only very small moons, tilts at
wildly ﬂuctuating angles, and cannot support life.
If the statements above are true, which one of the
following must also be true on the basis of them?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

If Mars had a sufﬁciently large nearby moon,
Mars would be able to support life.
If Earth’s Moon were to leave Earth’s orbit
Earth’s climate would be unable to support life.
Any planet with a stable, moderate axis tilt can
support life.
Gravitational inﬂuences other than moons have
little or no effect on the magnitude of the tilt
angle of either Earth’s or Mars’s axis.
No planet that has more than one moon can
support life.

15. The town of Springhill frequently must declare a water
emergency, making it temporarily unlawful to use
water for such nonessential purposes as car washing.
These emergencies could be avoided if Springhill
would introduce permanent economic incentives for
water conservation. Actually, Springhill discourages
conservation because each household pays a modest
monthly ﬂat fee for any amount of water below a
certain usage threshold, and a substantial per-liter rate
only after the threshold is reached.

17. When a community opens a large shopping mall, it
often expects a boost to the local economy, and in fact
a large amount of economic activity goes on in these
malls. Yet the increase in the local economy is typically
much smaller than the total amount of economic
activity that goes on in the mall.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the discrepancy described above?
(A)

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The Springhill authorities do a poor job of
enforcing its water emergency laws and many
people break the laws without incurring a
penalty.
The town council of Springhill recently refused
to raise the threshold.
The threshold is kept at a high enough level
to exceed the water requirements of most
households in Springhill.
The threshold is not as high in Springhill as it is
in neighboring towns.
The threshold remains at the predetermined level
speciﬁed by law until a change is approved by
the Springhill town council.

16. Poppy petals function to attract pollinating insects. The
pollination of a poppy ﬂower triggers the release into
that ﬂower of a substance that causes its petals to wilt
within one or two days. If the ﬂower is not pollinated,
the substance will not be released and the petals will
remain fresh for a week or longer, as long as the plant
can nourish them. Cutting an unpollinated poppy
ﬂower from the plant triggers the release into the ﬂower
of the same substance whose release is triggered by
pollination.
The statements above, if true, most strongly support
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Pollinating insects are not attracted to wilted
poppy ﬂowers.
Even if cut poppies are given all necessary
nutrients, their petals will tend to wilt within a
few days.
Flowers of all plants release the substance that
causes wilting when they are cut, although the
amount released may vary.
The pollen on pollinated poppy ﬂowers prevents
their petals from absorbing the nutrients carried
to them by their stems.
Poppy plants are unable to draw nutrients from
soil or water after the substance that causes
wilting has been released.

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

When large shopping malls are new they attract
a lot of shoppers but once the novelty has worn
off they usually attract fewer shoppers than does
the traditional downtown shopping district.
Most of the money spent in a large shopping mall
is spent by tourists who are drawn speciﬁcally
by the mall and who would not have visited the
community had that mall not been built.
Most of the jobs created by large shopping malls
are ﬁlled by people who recently moved to the
community and who would not have moved had
there been no job offer in the community.
Most of the money spent in a large shopping mall
is money that would have been spent elsewhere
in the same community had that mall not been
built.
Most of the jobs created by the construction of a
large shopping mall are temporary, and most of
the permanent jobs created are low paying.

18. Essayist: The way science is conducted and regulated
can be changed. But we need to determine
whether the changes are warranted, taking into
account their price. The use of animals in research
could end immediately, but only at the cost of
abandoning many kinds of research and making
others very expensive. The use of recombinant
DNA could be drastically curtailed. Many other
restrictions could be imposed, complete with
a system of fraud police. But such massive
interventions would be costly and would change
the character of science.

20. If the economy is weak, then prices remain constant
although unemployment rises. But unemployment rises
only if investment decreases. Fortunately, investment is
not decreasing.
If the statements above are true, then which one of the
following must be false?
(A)
(B)
(C)

Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the essayist’s argument?

(D)

(A)

(E)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

We should not make changes that will alter the
character of science.
If we regulate science more closely, we will
change the character of science.
The regulation of science and the conducting of
science can be changed.
The imposition of restrictions on the conduct of
science would be very costly.
We need to be aware of the impact of change in
science before changes are made.

19. The postmodern view involves the rejection of modern
assumptions about order and the universality of truth.
The grand theories of the modern era are now seen as
limited by the social and historical contexts in which
they were elaborated. Also, the belief in order has given
way to a belief in the importance of irregularity and
chaos. It follows that we inhabit a world full of irregular
events, and in which there are no universal truths.
The argument’s reasoning is questionable because the
argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

infers that something is the case because it is
believed to be the case
uses the term “universal” ambiguously
relies on the use of emotional terms to bolster its
conclusion
uses the term “order” ambiguously
fails to cite examples of modern theories that
purport to embody universal truths

Either the economy is weak or investment is
decreasing.
If unemployment rises, then prices remain
constant.
The economy is weak only if investment
decreases.
Either the economy is weak or prices are
remaining constant.
Either unemployment is rising or the economy is
not weak.

21. Psychologist: Some astrologers claim that
our horoscopes completely determine our
personalities, but this claim is false. I concede
that identical twins—who
—who are, of course, born
—
at practically the same time—often do have
similar personalities. However, birth records
were examined to ﬁnd two individuals who were
born 40 years ago on the same day and at exactly
the same time—one in a hospital in Toronto
and one in a hospital in New York. Personality
tests revealed that the personalities of these two
individuals are in fact different.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the psychologist’s argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Astrologers have not subjected their claims to
rigorous experimentation.
The personality differences between the two
individuals cannot be explained by the cultural
differences between Toronto and New York.
The geographical difference between Toronto
and New York did not result in the two
individuals having different horoscopes.
Complete birth records for the past 40 years were
kept at both hospitals.
Identical twins have identical genetic structures
and usually have similar home environments.

22. Under the inﬂuence of today’s computer-oriented
culture, publishing for children has taken on a ﬂashy
new look that emphasizes illustrations and graphic
design; the resulting lack of substance leads to books
that are short-lived items covering mainly trendy
subjects. The changes also include more humorous
content, simpliﬁcation of difﬁcult material, and a
narrower focus on speciﬁc topics.

24. We ought to pay attention only to the intrinsic
properties of a work of art. Its other, extrinsic
properties are irrelevant to our aesthetic interactions
with it. For example, when we look at a painting we
should consider only what is directly presented in our
experience of it. What is really aesthetically relevant,
therefore, is not what a painting symbolizes, but what it
directly presents to experience.

Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?

The conclusion follows logically if which one of the
following is added to the premises?

(A)

(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The inclusion of humorous material and a
narrower focus detract from the substance of a
children’s book.
The substance of a children’s book is important
to its longevity.
Children of the computer generation cannot
concentrate on long, unbroken sections of prose.
Children judge books primarily on the basis of
graphic design.
The lack of substance of a children’s book
is unlikely to be important to its popularity.

23. Further evidence of a connection between brain
physiology and psychological states has recently
been uncovered in the form of a correlation between
electroencephalograph patterns and characteristic
moods. A study showed that participants who suffered
from clinical depression exhibited less left frontal lobe
activity than right, while, conversely, characteristically
good-natured participants exhibited greater left lobe
activity. Thus one’s general disposition is a result of the
activity of one’s frontal lobe.
Each of the following, if true, weakens the argument
EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Many drugs prescribed to combat clinical
depression act by causing increased left lobe
activity.
Excessive sleep, a typical consequence of clinical
depression, is known to suppress left lobe
activity.
Frontal lobe activity is not subject to variation
the way general disposition is.
Earlier studies indicated that frontal lobe activity
and emotive states are both caused by activity in
the brain’s limbic system.
Social interaction of the kind not engaged in by
most clinically depressed people is known to
stimulate left lobe activity.

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

What an artwork symbolizes involves only the
extrinsic properties of that work.
There are certain properties of our experiences of
artworks that can be distinguished as symbolic
properties.
Only an artwork’s intrinsic properties are
relevant to our aesthetic interactions with it.
It is possible in theory for an artwork to
symbolize nothing.
An intrinsic property of an artwork is one that
relates the work to itself.

25. McKinley: A double-blind study, in which neither the
patient nor the primary researcher knows whether
the patient is being given the drug being tested
or a placebo, is the most effective procedure for
testing the efﬁcacy of a drug. But we will not be
able to perform such a study on this new drug,
since the drug will have various effects on the
patients’ bodies, which will make us aware of
whether the patients are getting the drug or a
placebo.
Engle: You cannot draw that conclusion at this point,
for you are assuming you know what the outcome
of the study will be.
Engle’s statement indicates that he is most likely
interpreting McKinley’s remarks to be

26. Modern navigation systems, which are found in most of
today’s commercial aircraft, are made with low-power
circuitry, which is more susceptible to interference than
the vacuum-tube circuitry found in older planes. During
landing, navigation systems receive radio signals
from the airport to guide the plane to the runway.
Recently, one plane with low-power circuitry veered
off course during landing, its dials dimming, when a
passenger turned on a laptop computer. Clearly, modern
aircraft navigation systems are being put at risk by the
electronic devices that passengers carry on board, such
as cassette players and laptop computers.
Which one of the following, if true, LEAST strengthens
the argument above?
(A)

presuming that a double-blind study is the only
effective way to test new drugs
denying that the drug will be effective
presuming that the placebo will produce no
effects whatever on the patients’ bodies
referring to the drug’s therapeutic effects rather
than to any known side effects
based on a confusion about when a drug is
efﬁcacious

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

After the laptop computer was turned off,
the plane regained course and its navigation
instruments and dials returned to normal.
When in use all electronic devices emit
electromagnetic radiation, which is known to
interfere with circuitry.
No problems with navigational equipment or
instrument dials have been reported on ﬂights
with no passenger-owned electronic devices on
board.
Signiﬁcant electromagnetic radiation from
portable electronic devices can travel up to eight
meters, and some passenger seats on modern
aircraft are located within four meters of the
navigation systems.
Planes were ﬁrst equipped with low-power
circuitry at about the same time portable
electronic devices became popular.

Flavonoids are a common component of almost all
plants, but a speciﬁc variety of ﬂavonoid in apples has
been found to be an antioxidant. Antioxidants are
known to be a factor in the prevention of heart disease.

3.

Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Birds startled by potential predators generally try to
take cover in nearby vegetation. Yet many birds that
feed at bird feeders placed in suburban gardens are
killed when, thus startled, they ﬂy away from the
vegetation in the gardens and into the windowpanes of
nearby houses.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the anomalous behavior of the birds that ﬂy into
windowpanes?

A diet composed largely of fruits and vegetables
will help to prevent heart disease.
Flavonoids are essential to preventing heart
disease.
Eating at least one apple each day will prevent
heart disease.

A number of Grandville’s wealthiest citizens have been
criminals. So, since it is of utmost importance that the
Grandville Planning Committee be composed solely of
individuals whose personal standards of ethics are
beyond reproach, no wealthy person should be
appointed to that committee.
The argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that it
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

confuses a result with something that is sufﬁcient
for bringing about that result
mistakes a temporal relationship for a causal
relationship
assumes that because a certain action has a
certain result the person taking that action
intended that result
judges only by subjective standards something
that can be readily evaluated according to
objective standards
generalizes on the basis of what could be
exceptional cases

(D)
(E)
4.

Predator attacks are as likely to occur at bird
feeders surrounded by dense vegetation as
they are at feeders surrounded by little or no
vegetation.
The bird feeders in some suburban gardens
are placed at a considerable distance from the
houses.
Large birds are as likely as small birds to ﬂy into
windowpanes.
Most of the birds startled while feeding at bird
feeders placed in suburban gardens are startled
by loud noises rather than by predators.
The windowpanes of many houses clearly reﬂect
surrounding vegetation.

Jane: Television programs and movies that depict violence
among teenagers are extremely popular. Given how
inﬂuential these media are, we have good reason
to believe that these depictions cause young people
to engage in violent behavior. Hence, depictions of
violence among teenagers should be prohibited from
movies and television programs, if only in those
programs and movies promoted to young audiences.

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)
6.

It presupposes that an unpopular policy cannot
possibly achieve its intended purpose.
It confuses a subjective judgment of private
moral permissibility with an objective
description of social fact.
It rules out something as a cause of a current
phenomenon solely on the ground that the
phenomenon used to occur without that thing.
It cites purported historical facts that cannot
possibly be veriﬁed.
It relies on an ambiguity in the term “violence”
to justify a claim.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
Jane’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

The most violent characters depicted in movies
and on television programs are adult characters
who are portrayed by adult actors.
The movies that have been shown to have the
most inﬂuence on young people’s behavior are
those that are promoted to young audiences.
The people who make the most proﬁts in the
movie and television industry are those who can
successfully promote their work to both young
and old audiences.
Many adolescents who engage in violent
behavior had already displayed such behavior
before they were exposed to violence in movies.
Among the producers who make both movies
and television programs, many voluntarily
restrict the subject matter of ﬁlms directed
toward young audiences.

Tiya:

But some manufacturing defects in automobiles
become apparent only after several years of use.

(A)
(B)

Maurice’s attempted refutation of Jane’s argument is
vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following
grounds?
(A)

In a recent survey, over 95 percent of people
who purchased a Starlight automobile last year
said they were highly satisﬁed with their purchase.
Since people who have purchased a new car in the
last year are not highly satisﬁed if that car has a
manufacturing defect, Starlight automobiles are
remarkably free from such defects.

Which one of the following most accurately describes
how Tiya’s response is related to Sam’s argument?

Maurice: But you are recommending nothing short of
censorship! Besides which, your claim that television
and movie depictions of violence cause violence is
mistaken: violence among young people predates
movies and television by centuries.

Some environmentalists question the prudence of
exploiting features of the environment, arguing that
there are no economic beneﬁts to be gained from
forests, mountains, or wetlands that no longer exist.

Market research traditionally entails surveying
consumers about why they buy and use particular
products and brands. Observational research
research—actually
watching consumers shopping and interacting with
products—is now increasingly used by market
researchers to supplement surveys. Market researchers
claim that observational research yields information
about consumer behavior that surveys alone cannot
provide.
Which one of the following, if true, provides the
strongest support for the market researchers’ claim?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Even consumers who are unable to explain their
preference for or rejection of particular brands
reveal which brands they are considering by
picking up and putting down products while
they are shopping.
Market researchers ﬁnd that consumers
are almost always willing to participate in
observational research for which the consumer
is paid by the hour.
Consumers are becoming increasingly selfconscious about their buying habits, and some
consumers have stopped buying some items that
they normally used to buy.
Market researchers say they ﬁnd data collection
more enjoyable in observational research than in
survey research, because observational research
requires more creative judgment on their part.
Consumers are more likely to respond to oral
surveys than they are to respond to written
questionnaires.

10. Laura: Harold is obviously lonely. He should sell his
cabin in the woods and move into town. In town
he will be near other people all the time, so he will

11. A rise in the percentage of all 18-year-olds who were
recruited by the armed services of a small republic
between 1980 and 1986 correlates with a rise in the
percentage of young people who dropped out of high
school in that republic. Since 18-year-olds in the
republic are generally either high school graduates
or high school dropouts, the correlation leads to the
conclusion that the republic’s recruitment rates for
18-year-olds depend substantially on recruitment rates
for high school dropouts.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

A larger number of 18-year-old high school
graduates were recruited for the republic’s
armed services in 1986 than in 1980.
Many of the high-technology systems used by
the republic’s armed services can be operated
only by individuals who have completed a high
school education.
Between 1980 and 1986 the percentage of high
school graduates among 18-year-olds recruited
in the republic rose sharply.
Personnel of the republic’s armed services are
strongly encouraged to ﬁnish their high school
education.
The proportion of recruits who had completed at
least two years of college education was greater
in 1986 than in 1980.

12. Letter to the Editor: Your article on effective
cockroach control states that vexone is effective
against only one of the more than 4,000 cockroach
species that infest North America: the German
cockroach. In actuality, vexone has been utilized
effectively for almost a decade against all of the
species that infest North America. In testing our
product, Roach Ender, which contains vexone, we
have conducted many well-documented studies
that prove this fact.
Each of the following statements conﬂicts with the
letter writer’s view EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Vexone is effective against only two species of
cockroach that infest North America.
Not all of the major species of cockroach that
infest North America can be controlled by
Roach Ender.
Every species of cockroach that infests North
America can be controlled by vexone.
The cockroach infestations that have been
combated with vexone have not included all of
the cockroach species that infest North America.
Roach Ender was tested against exactly 4,000
cockroach species that infest North America.

13. A recent study concludes that prehistoric birds, unlike
modern birds, were cold-blooded. This challenges a
widely held view that modern birds descended from
warm-blooded birds. The conclusion is based on the
existence of growth rings in prehistoric birds’ bodily
structures, which are thought to be found only in coldblooded animals. Another study, however, disputes this
view. It concludes that prehistoric birds had dense blood
vessels in their bones, which suggests that they were
active creatures and therefore had to be warm-blooded.
Which one of the following, if true, would most help
to resolve the dispute described above in favor of one
party to it?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Some modern warm-blooded species other than
birds have been shown to have descended from
cold-blooded species.
Having growth rings is not the only physical trait
of cold-blooded species.
Modern birds did not evolve from prehistoric
species of birds.
Dense blood vessels are not found in all warm
blooded species.
In some cold-blooded species the gene that is
responsible for growth rings is also responsible
for dense blood vessels.

14. If citizens do not exercise their right to vote, then
democratic institutions will crumble and, as a
consequence, much valuable social cohesion will be
lost. Of course, one person’s vote can only make an
imperceptible difference to the result of an election, but
one must consider the likely effects of large numbers
of people failing to vote. An act or omission by one
person is not right if such an act or omission done by
large numbers of people would be socially damaging.
Organized society would be impossible if theft were
common, though a single dishonest act on the part of
a single person is likely to have an insigniﬁcant effect
upon society.

15. Human beings have cognitive faculties that are superior
to those of other animals, and once humans become

calls into question the view above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

16. Historian: We can learn about the medical history
of individuals through chemical analysis of their
hair. It is likely, for example, that Isaac Newton’s
psychological problems were due to mercury
poisoning; traces of mercury were found in
his hair. Analysis is now being done on a lock
of Beethoven’s hair. Although no convincing
argument has shown that Beethoven ever had
a venereal disease, some people hypothesize
that venereal disease caused his deafness. Since
mercury was commonly ingested in Beethoven’s
time to treat venereal disease, if researchers ﬁnd a
trace of mercury in his hair, we can conclude that
this hypothesis is correct.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the historian’s argument depends?
(A)

Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the argument?

(B)

(A)

(C)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

People in a democracy should not neglect to
vote.
Dishonest acts and failure to vote are equally
damaging.
There is a risk that individual antisocial acts will
be imitated by others.
A single person’s vote or wrongful act can in fact
make a great deal of difference.
Large-scale dishonesty and neglect of public
duty will be destructive of democratic and other
societies.

Certain animals—dolphins and chimpanzees,
for example—appear to be capable of rational
communication.
Many people familiar both with intellectual
stimulation and with physical pleasures enjoy
the latter more.
Someone who never experienced classical music
as a child will usually prefer popular music as
an adult.
Many people who are serious athletes consider
themselves to be happy.
Many people who are serious athletes love
gourmet food.

(D)
(E)

None of the mercury introduced into the body
can be eliminated.
Some people in Beethoven’s time did not ingest
mercury.
Mercury is an effective treatment for venereal
disease.
Mercury poisoning can cause deafness in people
with venereal disease.
Beethoven suffered from psychological problems
of the same severity as Newton’s.

17. In 1992, a major newspaper circulated throughout North
America paid its reporters an average salary that was
much lower than the average salary paid by its principal
competitors to their reporters. An executive of the
newspaper argued that this practice was justiﬁed, since
any shortfall that might exist in the reporters’ salaries is
fully compensated by the valuable training they receive
through their assignments.
Which one of the following, if true about the newspaper
in 1992, most seriously undermines the justiﬁcation
offered by the executive?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Senior reporters at the newspaper earned as
much as reporters of similar stature who worked
for the newspaper’s principal competitors.
Most of the newspaper’s reporters had worked
there for more than ten years.
The circulation of the newspaper had recently
reached a plateau, after it had increased steadily
throughout the 1980s.
The union that represented reporters at the
newspaper was different from the union that
represented reporters at the newspaper’s
competitors.
The newspaper was widely read throughout
continental Europe and Great Britain as well as
North America.

18. The human brain and its associated mental capacities
evolved to assist self-preservation. Thus, the capacity
to make aesthetic judgments is an adaptation to past
environments in which humans lived. So an individual’s
aesthetic judgments must be evaluated in terms of
the extent to which they promote the survival of that
individual.
Which one of the following is a principle that would,
if valid, provide the strongest justiﬁcation for the
reasoning above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

All human adaptations to past environments were
based on the human brain and its associated
mental capacities.
Human capacities that do not contribute to the
biological success of the human species cannot
be evaluated.
If something develops to serve a given function,
the standard by which it must be judged is how
well it serves that function.
Judgments that depend on individual preference
or taste cannot be evaluated as true or false.
Anything that enhances the proliferation of a
species is to be valued highly.

19. On a certain day, nine scheduled ﬂights on Swift
Airlines were canceled. Ordinarily, a cancellation is due
to mechanical problems with the airplane scheduled
for a certain ﬂight. However, since it is unlikely that
Swift would have mechanical problems with more than
one or two airplanes on a single day, some of the nine
cancellations were probably due to something else.
The argument depends on which one of the following
assumptions?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

More than one or two airplanes were scheduled
for the nine canceled ﬂights.
Swift Airlines has fewer mechanical problems
than do other airlines of the same size.
Each of the canceled ﬂights would have been
longer than the average ﬂight on Swift Airlines.
Swift Airlines had never before canceled more
than one or two scheduled ﬂights on a single
day.
All of the airplanes scheduled for the canceled
ﬂights are based at the same airport.

investing, that is, they do not attain a better return
on their investments than apes do. We gave ﬁve
stock analysts and one chimpanzee $1,350 each
to invest. After one month, the chimp won, having
increased its net worth by $210. The net worth of
the analyst who came in second increased by only
$140.
Each of the following describes a ﬂaw in the game
show host’s reasoning EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A conclusion is drawn about apes in general
on the basis of an experiment involving one
chimpanzee.
No evidence is offered that chimpanzees are
capable of understanding stock reports and
making reasoned investment decisions.
A broad conclusion is drawn about the
investment skills of humans on the basis of what
is known about ﬁve humans.
Too general a conclusion is made about investing
on the basis of a single experiment involving
short-term investing but not long-term investing.
No evidence is considered about the long-term
performance of the chimpanzee’s portfolio
versus that of the analysts’ portfolios.

21. If the law punishes littering, then the city has an
obligation to provide trash cans. But the law does not

22. Researcher: The role of chemicals called pheromones
in determining the sexual behavior of some
animals is well documented. But, even though
humans also produce these chemicals, it is clear
that psychological factors have taken over this
role in us. Whereas for animals these behaviors
are involuntary, which is a clear sign of chemical
control, humans, by virtue of their free will,
choose how they behave, and thus psychological
factors take over. So pheromones are merely a
vestige of our evolutionary past.
The researcher’s argument requires the assumption that

whatever does not have a chemical explanation
must have a purely psychological one
voluntary action cannot have a chemical
explanation
free will can be found only in humans

explanation
there is a psychological explanation for the
continuing presence of pheromones in humans

24. Surviving seventeenth-century Dutch landscapes
attributed to major artists now equal in number those
attributed to minor ones. But since in the seventeenth
century many proliﬁc minor artists made a living
supplying the voracious market for Dutch landscapes,
while only a handful of major artists painted in the
genre, many attributions of seventeenth-century Dutch
landscape paintings to major artists are undoubtedly
erroneous.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Technically gifted seventeenth-century Dutch
landscape artists developed recognizable styles
that were difﬁcult to imitate.
In the workshops of major seventeenth-century
artists, assistants were employed to prepare the
paints, brushes, and other materials that the
major artists then used.
In the eighteenth century, landscapes by minor
seventeenth-century artists were often simply
thrown away or else destroyed through improper
storage.
Seventeenth-century art dealers paid minor artists
extra money to leave their landscapes unsigned
so that the dealers could add phony signatures
and pass such works off as valuable paintings.
More seventeenth-century Dutch landscapes
were painted than have actually survived, and
that is true of those executed by minor artists as
well as of those executed by major artists.

25. The interstitial nucleus, a subregion of the brain’s
hypothalamus, is typically smaller for male cats than for
female cats. A neurobiologist performed autopsies on
male cats who died from disease X, a disease affecting
no more than .05 percent of male cats, and found that
these male cats had interstitial nuclei that were as large
as those generally found in female cats. Thus, the size
of the interstitial nucleus determines whether or not
male cats can contract disease X.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
seriously weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)

(D)
(E)

No female cats have been known to contract
disease X, which is a subtype of disease Y.
Many male cats who contract disease X also
contract disease Z, the cause of which is
unknown.
The interstitial nuclei of female cats who
contract disease X are larger than those of
female cats who do not contract disease X.
Of 1,000 autopsies on male cats who did not

larger than those of the average male cat.
The hypothalamus is known not to be causally

Some Native American tribes have had difﬁculty
establishing their land claims because the United States
government did not recognize their status as tribes;
therefore during the 1970s some Native Americans
attempted to obtain such recognition through the
medium of U.S. courts. In presenting these suits,
Native Americans had to operate within a particular
sphere of U.S. government procedure, that of its legal
system, and their arguments were necessarily
interpreted by the courts in terms the law could
understand: e.g., through application of precedent or
review of evidence. This process brought to light some
of the differing perceptions and deﬁnitions that can
exist between cultures whose systems of discourse are
sometimes at variance.
In one instance, the entire legal dispute turned on
whether the suing community
community—a group of Mashpee
Wampanoag in the town of Mashpee, Massachusetts—
constituted a tribe. The area had long been occupied by
the Mashpee, who continued to have control over land
use after the town’s incorporation. But in the 1960s,
after an inﬂux of non-Mashpee people shifted the
balance of political power in the town, the new
residents were able to buy Mashpee-controlled land
from the town and develop it for commercial or private
use. The Mashpee’s 1976 suit claimed that these lands
were taken in violation of a statute prohibiting transfers
of land from any tribe of Native Americans without
federal approval. The town argued that the Mashpee
were not a tribe in the sense intended by the statute and
so were outside its protection. As a result, the Mashpee
were required to demonstrate their status as a tribe
according to a deﬁnition contained in an earlier ruling:
a body of Native Americans “governing themselves
under one leadership and inhabiting a particular
territory.”
The town claimed that the Mashpee were not selfgoverning and that they had no deﬁned territory: the
Mashpee could legally be self-governing, the town
argued, only if they could show written documentation
of such a system, and could legally inhabit territory
only if they had precisely delineated its boundaries and
possessed a deed to it. The Mashpee marshaled oral
testimony against these claims, arguing that what the
town perceived as a lack of evidence was simply
information that an oral culture such as the Mashpee’s
would not have recorded in writing. In this instance,
the disjunction between U.S. legal discourse and
Mashpee culture—exempliﬁed in the court’s inability
to “understand” the Mashpee’s oral testimony as

documentary evidence—rendered
—rendered the suit unsuccessful.
—
Similar claims have recently met with greater success,
however, as U.S. courts have begun to acknowledge
that the failure to accommodate differences in
discourse between cultures can sometimes stand in the
way of guaranteeing the fairness of legal decisions.

Land claim suits such as the Mashpee’s establish
that such suits must be bolstered by written

Land claim suits such as the Mashpee’s
underscore the need for U.S. courts to modify
their deﬁnition of “tribe.”
Land claim suits such as the Mashpee’s illustrate
the complications that can result when cultures
with different systems of discourse attempt to
resolve disputes.
Land claim suits such as the Mashpee’s point out
discrepancies between what U.S. courts claim
they will recognize as evidence and what forms
of evidence they actually accept.
Land claim suits such as the Mashpee’s bring to
light the problems faced by Native American
tribes attempting to establish their claims within

Long after the lava has cooled, the effects of a
major volcanic eruption may linger on. In the
atmosphere a veil of ﬁne dust and sulfuric acid droplets
can spread around the globe and persist for years.
Researchers have generally thought that this veil can
block enough sunlight to have a chilling inﬂuence on
Earth’s climate. Many blame the cataclysmic eruption
of the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815 for the
ensuing “year without a summer” of 1816—when parts
of the northeastern United States and southeastern
Canada were hit by snowstorms in June and frosts in
August.
The volcano-climate connection seems plausible,
but, say scientists Clifford Mass and David Portman, it
is not as strong as previously believed. Mass and
Portman analyzed global temperature data for the years
before and after nine volcanic eruptions, from Krakatau
in 1883 to El Chichon in 1982. In the process they tried
to ﬁlter out temperature changes caused by the cyclic
weather phenomenon known as the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation, which warms the sea surface in the
equatorial Paciﬁc and thereby warms the atmosphere.
Such warming can mask the cooling brought about by
an eruption, but it can also mimic volcanic cooling if
the volcano happens to erupt just as an El Ninoinduced warm period is beginning to fade.
Once El Nino effects had been subtracted from the
data, the actual effects of the eruptions came through
more clearly. Contrary to what earlier studies had
suggested, Mass and Portman found that minor
eruptions have no discernible effect on temperature.
And major, dust-spitting explosions, such as Krakatau
or El Chichon, cause a smaller drop than expected in the
average temperature in the hemisphere (Northern or
Southern) of the eruption
eruption—only half a degree
centigrade or less—with
—with a correspondingly smaller
—
drop in the opposite hemisphere.
Other researchers, however, have argued that even
a small temperature drop could result in a signiﬁcant
regional ﬂuctuation in climate if its effects were
ampliﬁed by climatic feedback loops. For example, a
small temperature drop in the northeastern U.S. and
southeastern Canada in early spring might delay the
melting of snow, and the unmelted snow would
continue to reﬂect sunlight away from the surface,
amplifying the cooling. The cool air over the region
could, in turn, affect the jet stream. The jet stream
tends to ﬂow at the boundary between cool northern air
and warm southern air, drawing its power from the
sharp temperature contrast and the consequent
difference in pressure. An unusual cooling in the region
could cause the stream to wander farther south than
normal, allowing more polar air to come in behind it and
deepen the region’s cold snap. Through such a
series of feedbacks a small temperature drop could be
blown up into a year without a summer.

Recently, a new school of economics called steadystate economics has seriously challenged neoclassical
economics, the reigning school in Western economic
decision making. According to the neoclassical model,
an economy is a closed system involving only the
circular ﬂow of exchange value between producers and
consumers. Therefore, no noneconomic constraints
impinge upon the economy and growth has no limits.
Indeed, some neoclassical economists argue that
growth itself is crucial, because, they claim, the
solutions to problems often associated with growth
(income inequities, for example) can be found only in
the capital that further growth creates.
Steady-state economists believe the neoclassical
model to be unrealistic and hold that the economy is
dependent on nature. Resources, they argue, enter the
economy as raw material and exit as consumed
products or waste; the greater the resources, the greater
the size of the economy. According to these
economists, nature’s limited capacity to regenerate
raw material and absorb waste suggests that there
is an optimal size for the economy, and that growth
beyond this ideal point would increase the cost to the
environment at a faster rate than the beneﬁt to
producers and consumers, generating cycles that
impoverish rather than enrich. Steady-state economists
thus believe that the concept of an ever growing
economy is dangerous, and that the only alternative is
to maintain a state in which the economy remains in
equilibrium with nature. Neoclassical economists, on
the other hand, consider nature to be just one element
of the economy rather than an outside constraint,
believing that natural resources, if depleted, can be
replaced with other elements—i.e.,
—i.e., human-made
—
resources—that
—that will allow the economy to continue
—
with its process of unlimited growth.
Some steady-state economists, pointing to the
widening disparity between indices of actual growth
(which simply count the total monetary value of goods
and services) and the index of environmentally
sustainable growth (which is based on personal
consumption, factoring in depletion of raw materials
and production costs), believe that Western economies
have already exceeded their optimal size. In response
to the warnings from neoclassical economists that
checking economic growth only leads to economic
stagnation, they argue that there are alternatives to
growth that still accomplish what is required of any
economy: the satisfaction of human wants. One of
these alternatives is conservation. Conservation
Conservation—for
example, increasing the efﬁciency of resource use
through means such as recycling
recycling—differs from growth
in that it is qualitative, not quantitative, requiring
improvement in resource management rather than an
increase in the amount of resources. One measure of
the success of a steady-state economy would be the
degree to which it could implement alternatives to
growth, such as conservation, without sacriﬁcing the
ability to satisfy the wants of producers and consumers.

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Neoclassical economists, who, unlike
steady-state economists, hold that economic
growth is not subject to outside constraints,
believe that nature is just one element of
the economy and that if natural resources in
Western economies are depleted they can be
replaced with human-made resources.
Some neoclassical economists, who, unlike
steady-state economists, hold that growth is
crucial to the health of economies, believe that
the solutions to certain problems in Western
economies can thus be found in the additional
capital generated by unlimited growth.
Some steady-state economists, who, unlike
neoclassical economists, hold that unlimited
growth is neither possible nor desirable, believe
that Western economies should limit economic
growth by adopting conservation strategies,
even if such strategies lead temporarily to
economic stagnation.
Some steady-state economists, who, unlike
neoclassical economists, hold that the
optimal sizes of economies are limited by the
availability of natural resources, believe that
Western economies should limit economic
growth and that, with alternatives like
conservation, satisfaction of human wants need
not be sacriﬁced.
Steady-state and neoclassical economists, who
both hold that economies involve the circular
ﬂow of exchange value between producers and
consumers, nevertheless differ over the most
effective way of guaranteeing that a steady
increase in this exchange value continues
unimpeded in Western economies.

likely hold that steady-state economists are wrong to
believe each of the following EXCEPT:

As one of the most pervasive and inﬂuential
popular arts, the movies feed into and off of the rest of
the culture in various ways. In the United States, the star
system of the mid-1920s—in
—in which actors were
—
placed under exclusive contract to particular
Hollywood ﬁlm studios—was
—was a consequence of
—
studios’ discovery that the public was interested in
actors’ private lives, and that information about actors
could be used to promote their ﬁlms. Public relations
agents fed the information to gossip columnists,
whetting the public’s appetite for the ﬁlms—which,
—
—which,
audiences usually discovered, had the additional virtue
of being created by talented writers, directors, and
producers devoted to the art of storytelling. The
important feature of this relationship was not the
beneﬁt to Hollywood, but rather to the press; in what
amounted to a form of cultural cross-fertilization, the
press saw that they could proﬁt from studios’
promotion of new ﬁlms.
Today this arrangement has mushroomed into an
intricately interdependent mass-media entertainment
industry. The faith by which this industry sustains itself
is the belief that there is always something worth
promoting. A vast portion of the mass media
media—
television and radio interviews, magazine articles, even
product advertisements—now
—now does most of the work
—
for Hollywood studios attempting to promote their
movies. It does so not out of altruism but because it
makes for good business: If you produce a talk show
or edit a newspaper, and other media are generating
public curiosity about a studio’s forthcoming ﬁlm, it
would be unwise for you not to broadcast or publish
something about the ﬁlm, too, because the audience for
your story is already guaranteed.
The problem with this industry is that it has begun
to affect the creation of ﬁlms as well as their
promotion. Choices of subject matter and actors are
made more and more frequently by studio executives
rather than by producers, writers, or directors. This
problem is often referred to simply as an obsession
with turning a proﬁt, but Hollywood movies have almost
always been produced to appeal to the largest possible
audience. The new danger is that,
increasingly, proﬁt comes only from exciting an
audience’s curiosity about a movie instead of satisfying
its desire to have an engaging experience watching
the ﬁlm. When movies can pull people into theaters
instantly on the strength of media publicity rather than
relying on the more gradual process of word of mouth
among satisﬁed moviegoers, then the intimate
relationship with the audience—on which the vitality
of all popular art depends—is
—is lost. But studios are
—
making more money than ever by using this formula,
and for this reason it appears that ﬁlms whose appeal is
due not merely to their publicity value but to their
ability to affect audiences emotionally will become
increasingly rare in the U.S. ﬁlm industry.
