SECTION I
Time—35 minutes
25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1.

Certain companies require their managers to rank
workers in the groups they supervise from best to
worst, giving each worker a unique ranking based on
job performance. The top 10 percent of the workers in
each group are rewarded and the bottom 10 percent are
penalized or ﬁred. But this system is unfair to workers.
Good workers could receive low rankings merely
because they belong to groups of exceptionally good
workers. Furthermore, managers often give the highest
rankings to workers who share the manager’s interests
outside of work.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn in the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Some companies require their managers to give
unique rankings to the workers they supervise.
Under the ranking system, the top 10 percent of
the workers in each group are rewarded and the
bottom 10 percent are penalized or ﬁred.
The ranking system is not a fair way to determine
penalties or rewards for workers.
Workers in exceptionally strong work groups are
unfairly penalized under the ranking system.
Managers often give the highest rankings to
workers who share the manager’s outside
interests.

2.

Psychologist: A study of 436 university students
found that those who took short naps throughout
the day suffered from insomnia more frequently
than those who did not. Moreover, people who
work on commercial ﬁshing vessels often have
irregular sleep patterns that include frequent
napping, and they also suffer from insomnia.
So it is very likely that napping tends to cause
insomnia.
The reasoning in the psychologist’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
university students suffer from insomnia more
frequently than do members of the general
population
presumes that all instances of insomnia have the
same cause
fails to provide a scientiﬁcally respectable
deﬁnition for the term “napping”
fails to consider the possibility that frequent
daytime napping is an effect rather than a cause
of insomnia
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
there is such a thing as a regular sleep pattern
for someone working on a commercial ﬁshing
vessel

Whenever Joe’s car is vacuumed, the employees of
K & L Auto vacuum it; they are the only people who
ever vacuum Joe’s car. If the employees of K & L
Auto vacuumed Joe’s car, then Joe took his car to K &
L Auto to be ﬁxed. Joe’s car was recently vacuumed.
Therefore, Joe took his car to K & L Auto to be ﬁxed.

5.

The pattern of reasoning exhibited by the argument
above is most similar to that exhibited by which one of
the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Emily’s water glass is wet and it would be wet
only if she drank water from it this morning.
Since the only time she drinks water in the
morning is when she takes her medication,
Emily took her medication this morning.
Lisa went to the hair salon today since either she
went to the hair salon today or she went to the
bank this morning, but Lisa did not go to the
bank this morning.
There are no bills on John’s kitchen table. Since
John gets at least one bill per day and he always
puts his bills on his kitchen table, someone else
must have checked John’s mail today.
Linda is grumpy only if she does not have her
coffee in the morning, and Linda does not have
her coffee in the morning only if she runs out of
coffee. Therefore, Linda runs out of coffee only
on days that she is grumpy.
Jeff had to choose either a grapefruit or cereal
for breakfast this morning. Given that Jeff is
allergic to grapefruit, Jeff must have had cereal
for breakfast this morning.

Everyone in Biba’s neighborhood is permitted to swim
at Barton Pool at some time during each day that it is
open. No children under the age of 6 are permitted to
swim at Barton Pool between noon and 5 P.M. From
5 P.M. until closing, Barton Pool is reserved for adults
only.
If all the sentences above are true, then which one of
the following must be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

6.

Beck: Our computer program estimates municipal
automotive use based on weekly data. Some
staff question the accuracy of the program’s
estimates. But because the ﬁgures it provides are
remarkably consistent from week to week, we can
be conﬁdent of its accuracy.
The reasoning in Beck’s argument is ﬂawed in that it
(A)
(B)

4.

Editorialist: In a large corporation, one of the
functions of the corporation’s president is to
promote the key interests of the shareholders.
Therefore, the president has a duty to keep the
corporation’s proﬁts high.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
strengthen the editorialist’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Shareholders sometimes will be satisﬁed even if
dividends paid to them from company proﬁts
are not high.
The president and the board of directors of
a corporation are jointly responsible for
advancing the key interests of the shareholders.
Keeping a corporation’s proﬁts high is likely
to advance the important interests of the
corporation’s shareholders.
In considering where to invest, most potential
shareholders are interested in more than just the
proﬁtability of a corporation.
The president of a corporation has many
functions besides advancing the important
interests of the corporation’s shareholders.

Few children under the age of 6 live in Biba’s
neighborhood.
If Biba’s next-door neighbor has a child under
the age of 6, then Barton Pool is open before
noon.
If most children who swim in Barton Pool swim
in the afternoon, then the pool is generally less
crowded after 5 P.M.
On days when Barton Pool is open, at least some
children swim there in the afternoon.
Any child swimming in Barton Pool before 5
P.M. must be breaking Barton Pool rules.

(C)
(D)
(E)

fails to establish that consistency is a more
important consideration than accuracy
fails to consider the program’s accuracy in other
tasks that it may perform
takes for granted that the program’s output
would be consistent even if its estimates were
inaccurate
regards accuracy as the sole criterion for judging
the program’s value
fails to consider that the program could produce
consistent but inaccurate output

Inertia affects the ﬂow of water pumped through a
closed system of pipes. When the pump is ﬁrst switched
on, the water, which has mass, takes time to reach full
speed. When the pump is switched off, inertia causes
the decrease in the water ﬂow to be gradual. The effects
of inductance in electrical circuits are similar to the
effects of inertia in water pipes.
The information above provides the most support for
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

8.

The rate at which electrical current ﬂows is
affected by inductance.
The ﬂow of electrical current in a circuit requires
inertia.
Inertia in the ﬂow of water pumped by an
electrically powered pump is caused by
inductance in the pump’s circuits.
Electrical engineers try to minimize the effects of
inductance in electrical circuits.
When a water pump is switched off it continues
to pump water for a second or two.

Journalist: To reconcile the need for proﬁts sufﬁcient
to support new drug research with the moral
imperative to provide medicines to those who
most need them but cannot afford them, some
pharmaceutical companies feel justiﬁed in selling
a drug in rich nations at one price and in poor
nations at a much lower price. But this practice is
unjustiﬁed. A nation with a low average income
may still have a substantial middle class better
able to pay for new drugs than are many of the
poorer citizens of an overall wealthier nation.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the journalist’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

People who are ill deserve more consideration
than do healthy people, regardless of their
relative socioeconomic positions.
Wealthy institutions have an obligation to expend
at least some of their resources to assist those
incapable of assisting themselves.
Whether one deserves special consideration
depends on one’s needs rather than on
characteristics of the society to which one
belongs.
The people in wealthy nations should not have
better access to health care than do the people in
poorer nations.
Unequal access to health care is more unfair than
an unequal distribution of wealth.

9.

Robert: The school board is considering adopting a
year-round academic schedule that eliminates the
traditional three-month summer vacation. This
schedule should be adopted, since teachers need
to cover more new material during the school year
than they do now.
Samantha: The proposed schedule will not permit
teachers to cover more new material. Even though
the schedule eliminates summer vacation, it adds
six new two-week breaks, so the total number of
school days will be about the same as before.
Which one of the following, if true, is a response Robert
could make that would counter Samantha’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Teachers would be willing to accept elimination
of the traditional three-month summer vacation
as long as the total vacation time they are
entitled to each year is not reduced.
Most parents who work outside the home ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to arrange adequate supervision for
their school-age children over the traditional
three-month summer vacation.
In school districts that have adopted a yearround schedule that increases the number of
school days per year, students show a deeper
understanding and better retention of new
material.
Teachers spend no more than a day of class time
reviewing old material when students have
been away from school for only a few weeks,
but have to spend up to a month of class time
reviewing after a three-month summer vacation.
Students prefer taking a long vacation from
school during the summer to taking more
frequent but shorter vacations spread throughout
the year.

10. In order to reduce trafﬁc congestion and raise revenue
for the city, the mayor plans to implement a charge
of $10 per day for driving in the downtown area.
Payment of this charge will be enforced using a highly
sophisticated system that employs digital cameras and
computerized automobile registration. This system will
not be ready until the end of next year. Without this
system, however, mass evasion of the charge will result.
Therefore, when the mayor’s plan is ﬁrst implemented,
payment of the charge will not be effectively enforced.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends for its conclusion to be properly
drawn?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The mayor’s plan to charge for driving
downtown will be implemented before the end
of next year.
The city will incur a budget deﬁcit if it does not
receive the revenue it expects to raise from the
charge for driving downtown.
The plan to charge for driving downtown should
be implemented as soon as payment of the
charge can be effectively enforced.
Raising revenue is a more important
consideration for the city than is reducing trafﬁc
congestion.
A daily charge for driving downtown is the most
effective way to reduce trafﬁc congestion.

11. A recent study revealed that the percentage of people
treated at large, urban hospitals who recover from their
illnesses is lower than the percentage for people treated
at smaller, rural hospitals.
Each of the following, if true, contributes to an
explanation of the difference in recovery rates
EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Because there are fewer patients to feed,
nutritionists at small hospitals are better able to
tailor meals to the dietary needs of each patient.
The less friendly, more impersonal atmosphere
of large hospitals can be a source of stress for
patients at those hospitals.
Although large hospitals tend to draw doctors
trained at the more prestigious schools, no
correlation has been found between the prestige
of a doctor’s school and patients’ recovery rate.
Because space is relatively scarce in large
hospitals, doctors are encouraged to minimize
the length of time that patients are held for
observation following a medical procedure.
Doctors at large hospitals tend to have a greater
number of patients and consequently less
time to explain to staff and to patients how
medications are to be administered.

12. Perry: Worker-owned businesses require workers to
spend time on management decision-making and
investment strategy, tasks that are not directly
productive. Also, such businesses have less
extensive divisions of labor than do investorowned businesses. Such inefﬁciencies can lead
to low proﬁtability, and thus increase the risk
for lenders. Therefore, lenders seeking to reduce
their risk should not make loans to worker-owned
businesses.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens Perry’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Businesses with the most extensive divisions of
labor sometimes fail to make the fullest use of
their most versatile employees’ potential.
Lenders who specialize in high-risk loans are
the largest source of loans for worker-owned
businesses.
Investor-owned businesses are more likely than
worker-owned businesses are to receive start-up
loans.
Worker-owned businesses have traditionally
obtained loans from cooperative lending
institutions established by coalitions of workerowned businesses.
In most worker-owned businesses, workers
compensate for inefﬁciencies by working
longer hours than do workers in investor-owned
businesses.

13. Some paleontologists believe that certain species of
dinosaurs guarded their young in protective nests
long after the young hatched. As evidence, they cite
the discovery of fossilized hadrosaur babies and
adolescents in carefully designed nests. But similar
nests for hatchlings and adolescents are constructed
by modern crocodiles, even though crocodiles guard
their young only for a very brief time after they hatch.
Hence, _________.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

paleontologists who believe that hadrosaurs
guarded their young long after the young
hatched have no evidence to support this belief
we will never be able to know the extent to
which hadrosaurs guarded their young
hadrosaurs guarded their young for at most very
brief periods after hatching
it is unclear whether what we learn about
hadrosaurs from their fossilized remains tells us
anything about other dinosaurs
the construction of nests for hatchlings and
adolescents is not strong evidence for the
paleontologists’ belief

14. For one academic year all the students at a high school
were observed. The aim was to test the hypothesis that
studying more increased a student’s chances of earning
a higher grade. It turned out that the students who spent
the most time studying did not earn grades as high as
did many students who studied less. Nonetheless, the
researchers concluded that the results of the observation
supported the initial hypothesis.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain why the researchers drew the conclusion
described above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The students who spent the most time studying
earned higher grades than did some students
who studied for less time than the average.
The students tended to get slightly lower grades
as the academic year progressed.
In each course, the more a student studied, the
better his or her grade was in that course.
The students who spent the least time studying
tended to be students with no more than average
involvement in extracurricular activities.
Students who spent more time studying
understood the course material better than other
students did.

15. Researchers had three groups of professional cyclists
cycle for one hour at different levels of intensity.
Members of groups A, B, and C cycled at rates that
sustained, for an hour, pulses of about 60 percent,
70 percent, and 85 percent, respectively, of the
recommended maximum pulse rate for recreational
cyclists. Most members of Group A reported being
less depressed and angry afterward. Most members of
Group B did not report these beneﬁts. Most members of
Group C reported feeling worse in these respects than
before the exercise.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

The higher the pulse rate attained in sustained
exercise, the less psychological beneﬁt the
exercise tends to produce.
The effect that a period of cycling has on the
mood of professional cyclists tends to depend at
least in part on how intense the cycling is.
For professional cyclists, the best exercise from
the point of view of improving mood is cycling
that pushes the pulse no higher than 60 percent
of the maximum pulse rate.
Physical factors, including pulse rate, contribute
as much to depression as do psychological
factors.
Moderate cycling tends to beneﬁt professional
cyclists physically as much or more than intense
cycling.

16. Anyone who believes in extraterrestrials believes in
UFOs. But the existence of UFOs has been conclusively
refuted. Therefore a belief in extraterrestrials is false as
well.
Which one of the following arguments contains ﬂawed
reasoning most similar to that in the argument above?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Anyone who believes in unicorns believes in
centaurs. But it has been demonstrated that
there are no centaurs, so there are no unicorns
either.
Anyone who believes in unicorns believes in
centaurs. But you do not believe in centaurs, so
you do not believe in unicorns either.
Anyone who believes in unicorns believes in
centaurs. But you do not believe in unicorns, so
you do not believe in centaurs either.
Anyone who believes in unicorns believes in
centaurs. But there is no good reason to believe
in centaurs, so a belief in unicorns is unjustiﬁed
as well.
Anyone who believes in unicorns believes in
centaurs. But it has been conclusively proven
that there is no such thing as a unicorn, so a
belief in centaurs is mistaken as well.

17. People want to be instantly and intuitively liked. Those
persons who are perceived as forming opinions of
others only after cautiously gathering and weighing the
evidence are generally resented. Thus, it is imprudent to
appear prudent.
Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the
argument’s conclusion to be properly drawn?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

People who act spontaneously are well liked.
Imprudent people act instantly and intuitively.
People resent those less prudent than themselves.
People who are intuitive know instantly when
they like someone.
It is imprudent to cause people to resent you.

18. Journalist: Recent studies have demonstrated that a
regular smoker who has just smoked a cigarette
will typically display signiﬁcantly better shortterm memory skills than a nonsmoker, whether
or not the nonsmoker has also just smoked a
cigarette for the purposes of the study. Moreover,
the majority of those smokers who exhibit this
superiority in short-term memory skills will do so
for at least eight hours after having last smoked.
If the journalist’s statements are true, then each of the
following could be true EXCEPT:
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The short-term memory skills exhibited by a
nonsmoker who has just smoked a cigarette are
usually substantially worse than the short-term
memory skills exhibited by a nonsmoker who
has not recently smoked a cigarette.
The short-term memory skills exhibited by a
nonsmoker who has just smoked a cigarette are
typically superior to those exhibited by a regular
smoker who has just smoked a cigarette.
The short-term memory skills exhibited by a
nonsmoker who has just smoked a cigarette are
typically superior to those exhibited by a regular
smoker who has not smoked for more than eight
hours.
A regular smoker who, immediately after
smoking a cigarette, exhibits short-term
memory skills no better than those typically
exhibited by a nonsmoker is nevertheless likely
to exhibit superior short-term memory skills in
the hours following a period of heavy smoking.
The short-term memory skills exhibited by a
regular smoker who last smoked a cigarette
ﬁve hours ago are typically superior to those
exhibited by a regular smoker who has just
smoked a cigarette.

19. Educator: It has been argued that our professional
organization should make decisions about
important issues-such as raising dues and taking
political stands-by a direct vote of all members
rather than by having members vote for ofﬁcers
who in turn make the decisions. This would not,
however, be the right way to decide these matters,
for the vote of any given individual is much
more likely to determine organizational policy
by inﬂuencing the election of an ofﬁcer than by
inﬂuencing the result of a direct vote on a single
issue.
Which one of the following principles would, if valid,
most help to justify the educator’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

No procedure for making organizational
decisions should allow one individual’s vote to
weigh more than that of another.
Outcomes of organizational elections should
be evaluated according to their beneﬁt to the
organization as a whole, not according to the
fairness of the methods by which they are
produced.
Important issues facing organizations should be
decided by people who can devote their full
time to mastering the information relevant to the
issues.
An ofﬁcer of an organization should not make a
particular decision on an issue unless a majority
of the organization’s members would approve of
that decision.
An organization’s procedures for making
organizational decisions should maximize the
power of each member of the organization to
inﬂuence the decisions made.

20. Neural connections carrying signals from the cortex
(the brain region responsible for thought) down to the
amygdala (a brain region crucial for emotions) are less
well developed than connections carrying signals from
the amygdala up to the cortex. Thus, the amygdala
exerts a greater inﬂuence on the cortex than vice versa.
The argument’s conclusion follows logically if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

The inﬂuence that the amygdala exerts on the
rest of the brain is dependent on the inﬂuence
that the cortex exerts on the rest of the brain.
No other brain region exerts more inﬂuence on
the cortex than does the amygdala.
The region of the brain that has the most
inﬂuence on the cortex is the one that has the
most highly developed neural connections to the
cortex.
The amygdala is not itself controlled by one or
more other regions of the brain.
The degree of development of a set of neural
connections is directly proportional to the
inﬂuence transmitted across those connections.

21. The Iliad and the Odyssey were both attributed to
Homer in ancient times. But these two poems differ
greatly in tone and vocabulary and in certain details
of the ﬁctional world they depict. So they are almost
certainly not the work of the same poet.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
weakens the reasoning above?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Several hymns that were also attributed to Homer
in ancient times differ more from the Iliad in the
respects mentioned than does the Odyssey.
Both the Iliad and the Odyssey have come
down to us in manuscripts that have suffered
from minor copying errors and other textual
corruptions.
Works known to have been written by the same
modern writer are as different from each other
in the respects mentioned as are the Iliad and
the Odyssey.
Neither the Iliad nor the Odyssey taken by itself
is completely consistent in all of the respects
mentioned.
Both the Iliad and the Odyssey were the result
of an extended process of oral composition in
which many poets were involved.

22. Moralist: A statement is wholly truthful only if it
is true and made without intended deception. A
statement is a lie if it is intended to deceive or if
its speaker, upon learning that the statement was
misinterpreted, refrains from clarifying it.
Which one of the following judgments most closely
conforms to the principles stated by the moralist?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Ted’s statement to the investigator that he had
been abducted by extraterrestrial beings was
wholly truthful even though no one has ever
been abducted by extraterrestrial beings.
After all, Ted was not trying to deceive the
investigator.
Tony was not lying when he told his
granddaughter that he did not wear dentures,
for even though Tony meant to deceive his
granddaughter, she made it clear to Tony that
she did not believe him.
Siobhan did not tell a lie when she told her
supervisor that she was ill and hence would
not be able to come to work for an important
presentation. However, even though her
statement was true, it was not wholly truthful.
Walter’s claim to a potential employer that he
had done volunteer work was a lie. Even though
Walter had worked without pay in his father’s
factory, he used the phrase “volunteer work”
in an attempt to deceive the interviewer into
thinking he had worked for a socially beneﬁcial
cause.
The tour guide intended to deceive the tourists
when he told them that the cabin they were
looking at was centuries old. Still, his
statement about the cabin’s age was not a lie,
for if he thought that this statement had been
misinterpreted, he would have tried to clarify it.

23. Principle: It is healthy for children to engage in
an activity that promotes their intellectual
development only if engaging in that activity does
not detract from their social development.
Application: Although Megan’s frequent reading
stimulates her intellectually, it reduces the amount
of time she spends interacting with other people.
Therefore, it is not healthy for her to read as much
as she does.
The application of the principle is most vulnerable to
criticism on which one of the following grounds?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

It misinterprets the principle as a universal claim
intended to hold in all cases without exception,
rather than as a mere generalization.
It overlooks the possibility that the beneﬁts of
a given activity may sometimes be important
enough to outweigh the adverse health effects.
It misinterprets the principle to be, at least in
part, a claim about what is unhealthy, rather
than solely a claim about what is healthy.
It takes for granted that any decrease in the
amount of time a child spends interacting
with others detracts from that child’s social
development.
It takes a necessary condition for an activity’s
being healthy as a sufﬁcient condition for its
being so.

25. Sociologist: Widespread acceptance of the idea
that individuals are incapable of looking after
their own welfare is injurious to a democracy.
So legislators who value democracy should not
propose any law prohibiting behavior that is not
harmful to anyone besides the person engaging in
it. After all, the assumptions that appear to guide
legislators will often become widely accepted.
The sociologist’s argument requires the assumption that
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

democratically elected legislators invariably have
favorable attitudes toward the preservation of
democracy
people tend to believe what is believed by those
who are prominent and powerful
legislators often seem to be guided by the
assumption that individuals are incapable of
looking after their own welfare, even though
these legislators also seem to value democracy
in most cases, behavior that is harmful to the
person who engages in it is harmful to no one
else
a legislator proposing a law prohibiting an act
that can harm only the person performing the
act will seem to be assuming that individuals
are incapable of looking after their own welfare

24. In response to several bacterial infections traced to its
apple juice, McElligott now ﬂash pasteurizes its apple
juice by quickly heating and immediately rechilling it.
Intensive pasteurization, in which juice is heated for
an hour, eliminates bacteria more effectively than does
any other method, but is likely to destroy the original
ﬂavor. However, because McElligott’s citrus juices have
not been linked to any bacterial infections, they remain
unpasteurized.
The statements above, if true, provide the most support
for which one of the following claims?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

McElligott’s citrus juices contain fewer
infectious bacteria than do citrus juices
produced by other companies.
McElligott’s apple juice is less likely to contain
infectious bacteria than are McElligott’s citrus
juices.
McElligott’s citrus juices retain more of the
juices’ original ﬂavor than do any pasteurized
citrus juices.
The most effective method for eliminating
bacteria from juice is also the method most
likely to destroy ﬂavor.
Apple juice that undergoes intensive
pasteurization is less likely than McElligott’s
apple juice is to contain bacteria.

Questions 1-7
Workers at a water treatment plant open eight valves—G,
H, I, K, L, N, O, and P—to ﬂush out a system of pipes
that needs emergency repairs. To maximize safety and
efﬁciency, each valve is opened exactly once, and no two
valves are opened at the same time. The valves are opened
in accordance with the following conditions:
Both K and P are opened before H.
O is opened before L but after H.
L is opened after G.
N is opened before H.
I is opened after K.

25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1.

Any museum that owns the rare stamp that features
an airplane printed upside down should not display it.
Ultraviolet light causes red ink to fade, and a substantial
portion of the stamp is red. If the stamp is displayed, it
will be damaged. It should be kept safely locked away,
even though this will deny the public the chance to see
it.
The reasoning above most closely conforms to which
one of the following principles?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

2.

The public should judge the quality of a museum
by the rarity of the objects in its collection.
Museum display cases should protect their
contents from damage caused by ultraviolet
light.
Red ink should not be used on items that will not
be exposed to ultraviolet light.
A museum piece that would be damaged by
display should not be displayed.
The primary purpose of a museum is to educate
the public.

Dietitian: Many diet-conscious consumers are excited
about new “fake fat” products designed to give
food the ﬂavor and consistency of fatty foods,
yet without fat’s harmful effects. Consumers who
expect the new fat substitute to help them lose
weight are likely to be disappointed, however.
Research has shown that when people knowingly
or unknowingly eat foods containing “fake fat,”
they tend to take in at least as many additional
calories as are saved by eating “fake fat.”
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion of the dietitian’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

People tend to take in a certain number of daily
calories, no matter what types of food they eat.
Most consumers who think that foods with “fake
fat” are more nutritious than fatty foods are
destined to be disappointed.
“Fake fat” products are likely to contribute to
obesity more than do other foods.
“Fake fat” in foods is probably not going to help
consumers meet weight loss goals.
“Fake fat” in foods is indistinguishable from
genuine fat by most consumers on the basis of
taste alone.

3.

Banking analyst: Banks often offer various services
to new customers at no charge. But this is not an
ideal business practice, since regular, long-term
customers, who make up the bulk of the business
for most banks, are excluded from these special
offers.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the banking analyst’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Most banks have similar charges for most
services and pay similar interest rates on
deposits.
Banks do best when offering special privileges
only to their most loyal customers.
Offering services at no charge to all of its current
customers would be prohibitively expensive for
a bank.
Once they have chosen a bank, people tend to
remain loyal to that bank.
Some banks that offer services at no charge to
new customers are very successful.

Panelist: Medical research articles cited in popular
newspapers or magazines are more likely than
other medical research articles to be cited in
subsequent medical research. Thus, it appears that
medical researchers’ judgments of the importance
of prior research are strongly inﬂuenced by
the publicity received by that research and do
not strongly correspond to the research’s true
importance.
The panelist’s argument is most vulnerable to criticism
on the grounds that it
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)
5.

presents counterarguments to a view that is not
actually held by any medical researcher
fails to consider the possibility that popular
newspapers and magazines do a good job of
identifying the most important medical research
articles
takes for granted that coverage of medical
research in the popular press is more concerned
with the eminence of the scientists involved
than with the content of their research
fails to consider the possibility that popular
newspapers and magazines are able to review
only a minuscule percentage of medical
research articles
draws a conclusion that is logically equivalent to
its premise

Lahar: We must now settle on a procedure for
deciding on meeting agendas. Our club’s
constitution allows three options: unanimous
consent, majority vote, or assigning the task to
a committee. Unanimous consent is unlikely.
Forming a committee has usually led to
factionalism and secret deals. Clearly, we should
subject meeting agendas to majority vote.
Lahar’s argument does which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

rejects suggested procedures on constitutional
grounds
claims that one procedure is the appropriate
method for reaching every decision in the club
suggests a change to a constitution on the basis
of practical considerations
recommends a choice based on the elimination of
alternative options
supports one preference by arguing against those
who have advocated alternatives

Mayor: Local antitobacco activists are calling for
expanded antismoking education programs
paid for by revenue from heavily increased
taxes on cigarettes sold in the city. Although
the effectiveness of such education programs
is debatable, there is strong evidence that the
taxes themselves would produce the sought-after
reduction in smoking. Surveys show that cigarette
sales drop substantially in cities that impose stiff
tax increases on cigarettes.
Which one of the following, if true, most undermines
the reasoning in the argument above?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

A city-imposed tax on cigarettes will
substantially reduce the amount of smoking in
the city if the tax is burdensome to the average
cigarette consumer.
Consumers are more likely to continue buying a
product if its price increases due to higher taxes
than if its price increases for some other reason.
Usually, cigarette sales will increase substantially
in the areas surrounding a city after that city
imposes stiff taxes on cigarettes.
People who are well informed about the effects
of long-term tobacco use are signiﬁcantly less
likely to smoke than are people who are not
informed.
Antismoking education programs that are funded
by taxes on cigarettes will tend to lose their
funding if they are successful.

Gotera: Infants lack the motor ability required to
voluntarily produce particular sounds, but produce
various babbling sounds randomly. Most children
are several years old before they can voluntarily
produce most of the vowel and consonant sounds
of their language. We can conclude that speech
acquisition is entirely a motor control process
rather than a process that is abstract or mental.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by Gotera’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

8.

Speech acquisition is a function only of one’s
ability to produce the sounds of spoken
language.
During the entire initial babbling stage, infants
cannot intentionally move their tongues while
they are babbling.
The initial babbling stage is completed during
infancy.
The initial babbling stage is the ﬁrst stage of the
speech acquisition process.
Control of tongue and mouth movements
requires a sophisticated level of mental
development.

Caldwell: The government recently demolished a
former naval base. Among the complex’s facilities
were a gymnasium, a swimming pool, ofﬁce
buildings, gardens, and housing for hundreds of
people. Of course the government was legally
permitted to use these facilities as it wished. But
clearly, using them for the good of the community
would have beneﬁted everyone, and thus the
government’s actions were not only inefﬁcient but
immoral.
Caldwell’s argument is most vulnerable to criticism on
the grounds that it
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

fails to consider that an action may be morally
permissible even if an alternative course of
action is to everyone’s advantage
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation,
that the actual consequences of an action are
irrelevant to the action’s moral permissibility
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
the government never acts in the most efﬁcient
manner
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
any action that is efﬁcient is also moral
inappropriately treats two possible courses of
action as if they were the only options

Reducing stress lessens a person’s sensitivity to pain.
This is the conclusion reached by researchers who
played extended audiotapes to patients before they
underwent surgery and afterward while they were
recovering. One tape consisted of conversation; the
other consisted of music. Those who listened only to
the latter tape required less anesthesia during surgery
and fewer painkillers afterward than those who listened
only to the former tape.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the researchers’ reasoning depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

All of the patients in the study listened to the
same tape before surgery as they listened to
after surgery.
Anticipating surgery is no less stressful than
recovering from surgery.
Listening to music reduces stress.
The psychological effects of music are not
changed by anesthesia or painkillers.
Both anesthesia and painkillers tend to reduce
stress.

10. Samuel: Because communication via computer is
usually conducted privately and anonymously
between people who would otherwise interact in
person, it contributes to the dissolution, not the
creation, of lasting communal bonds.
Tova: You assume that communication via computer
replaces more intimate forms of communication
and interaction, when more often it replaces
asocial or even antisocial behavior.
On the basis of their statements, Samuel and Tova
are committed to disagreeing about which one of the
following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

A general trend of modern life is to dissolve the
social bonds that formerly connected people.
All purely private behavior contributes to the
dissolution of social bonds.
Face-to-face communication is more likely to
contribute to the creation of social bonds than is
anonymous communication.
It is desirable that new social bonds be created to
replace the ones that have dissolved.
If people were not communicating via computer,
they would most likely be engaged in activities
that create stronger social bonds.

11. Spreading iron particles over the surface of the earth’s
oceans would lead to an increase in phytoplankton,
decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere and thereby counteracting the greenhouse
effect. But while counteracting the greenhouse effect is
important, the side effects of an iron-seeding strategy
have yet to be studied. Since the oceans represent such
an important resource, this response to the greenhouse
effect should not be implemented immediately.
The reasoning above most closely conforms to which
one of the following principles?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

A problem-solving strategy should be
implemented if the side effects of the strategy
are known.
Implementing a problem-solving strategy that
alters an important resource is impermissible
if the consequences are not adequately
understood.
We should not implement a problem-solving
strategy if the consequences of doing so are
more serious than the problem itself.
We should not implement a problem-solving
strategy if that strategy requires altering an
important resource.
As long as there is a possibility that a strategy for
solving a problem may instead exacerbate that
problem, such a solution should not be adopted.

12. No matter how conscientious they are, historians always
have biases that affect their work. Hence, rather than
trying to interpret historical events, historians should
instead interpret what the people who participated in
historical events thought about those events.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument fails to
consider the possibility that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

historians who have different biases often agree
about many aspects of some historical events
scholars in disciplines other than history also risk
having their biases affect their work
many of the ways in which historians’ biases
affect their work have been identiﬁed
not all historians are aware of the effect that their
particular biases have on their work
the proposed shift in focus is unlikely to
eliminate the effect that historians’ biases have
on their work

13. Humanitarian considerations aside, sheer economics
dictates that country X should institute, as country
Y has done, a nationwide system of air and ground
transportation for conveying seriously injured persons
to specialized trauma centers. Timely access to the
kind of medical care that only specialized centers
can provide could save the lives of many people. The
earnings of these people would result in a substantial
increase in country X’s gross national product, and
the taxes paid on those earnings would substantially
augment government revenues.
The argument depends on the assumption that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

lifetime per-capita income is roughly the same in
country X as it is in country Y
there are no specialized trauma centers in
country X at present
the treatment of seriously injured persons in
trauma centers is not more costly than treatment
elsewhere
there would be a net increase in employment
in country X if more persons survived serious
injury
most people seriously injured in automobile
accidents in country X do not now receive
treatment in specialized trauma centers

14. Early urban societies could not have been maintained
without large-scale farming nearby. This is because
other methods of food acquisition, such as foraging,
cannot support populations as dense as urban ones.
Large-scale farming requires irrigation, which remained
unfeasible in areas far from rivers or lakes until more
recent times.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Most peoples who lived in early times lived in
areas near rivers or lakes.
Only if farming is possible in the absence of
irrigation can societies be maintained in areas
far from rivers or lakes.
In early times it was not possible to maintain
urban societies in areas far from rivers or lakes.
Urban societies with farms near rivers or lakes
do not have to rely upon irrigation to meet their
farming needs.
Early rural societies relied more on foraging than
on agriculture for food.

15. Economist: A country’s rapid emergence from an
economic recession requires substantial new
investment in that country’s economy. Since
people’s conﬁdence in the economic policies
of their country is a precondition for any new
investment, countries that put collective goals
before individuals’ goals cannot emerge quickly
from an economic recession.
Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the
economist’s conclusion to be properly drawn?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

No new investment occurs in any country that
does not emerge quickly from an economic
recession.
Recessions in countries that put collective
goals before individuals’ goals tend not to
affect the country’s people’s support for their
government’s policies.
If the people in a country that puts individuals’
goals ﬁrst are willing to make new investments
in their country’s economy, their country will
emerge quickly from an economic recession.
People in countries that put collective goals
before individuals’ goals lack conﬁdence in the
economic policies of their countries.
A country’s economic policies are the most
signiﬁcant factor determining whether that
country’s economy will experience a recession.

16. The average length of stay for patients at Edgewater
Hospital is four days, compared to six days at
University Hospital. Since studies show that recovery
rates at the two hospitals are similar for patients with
similar illnesses, University Hospital could decrease its
average length of stay without affecting quality of care.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

equates the quality of care at a hospital with
patients’ average length of stay
treats a condition that will ensure the
preservation of quality of care as a condition
that is required to preserve quality of care
fails to take into account the possibility that
patients at Edgewater Hospital tend to be treated
for different illnesses than patients at University
Hospital
presumes, without providing justiﬁcation, that
the length of time patients stay in the hospital
is never relevant to the recovery rates of these
patients
fails to take into account the possibility that
patients at University Hospital generally prefer
longer hospital stays

17. Philosopher: Graham argues that since a person is
truly happy only when doing something, the best
life is a life that is full of activity. But we should
not be persuaded by Graham’s argument. People
sleep, and at least sometimes when sleeping, they
are truly happy, even though they are not doing
anything.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the philosopher’s argument by the
claim that at least sometimes when sleeping, people are
truly happy, even though they are not doing anything?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It is a premise of Graham’s argument.
It is an example intended to show that a premise
of Graham’s argument is false.
It is an analogy appealed to by Graham but that
the philosopher rejects.
It is an example intended to disprove the
conclusion of Graham’s argument.
It is the main conclusion of the philosopher’s
argument.

18. Historian: In rebuttal of my claim that West
inﬂuenced Stuart, some people point out that
West’s work is mentioned only once in Stuart’s
diaries. But Stuart’s diaries mention several
meetings with West, and Stuart’s close friend,
Abella, studied under West. Furthermore, Stuart’s
work often uses West’s terminology which,
though now commonplace, none of Stuart’s
contemporaries used.

20. There are two ways to manage an existing
transportation infrastructure: continuous maintenance
at adequate levels, and periodic radical reconstruction.
Continuous maintenance dispenses with the need
for radical reconstruction, and radical reconstruction
is necessitated by failing to perform continuous
maintenance. Over the long run, continuous
maintenance is far less expensive; nevertheless, it
almost never happens.

Which one of the following propositions is most
supported by the historian’s statements, if those
statements are true?

Which one of the following, if true, most contributes to
an explanation of why the ﬁrst alternative mentioned is
almost never adopted?

(A)

(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Stuart’s discussions with Abella were one of the
means by which West inﬂuenced Stuart.
It is more likely that Stuart inﬂuenced West than
that West inﬂuenced Stuart.
Stuart’s contemporaries were not inﬂuenced by
West.
Stuart’s work was not entirely free from West’s
inﬂuence.
Because of Stuart’s inﬂuence on other people,
West’s terminology is now commonplace.

19. One theory to explain the sudden extinction of all
dinosaurs points to “drug overdoses” as the cause.
Angiosperms, a certain class of plants, ﬁrst appeared
at the time that dinosaurs became extinct. These
plants produce amino-acid-based alkaloids that are
psychoactive agents. Most plant-eating mammals
avoid these potentially lethal poisons because they
taste bitter. Moreover, mammals have livers that help
detoxify such drugs. However, dinosaurs could neither
taste the bitterness nor detoxify the substance once it
was ingested. This theory receives its strongest support
from the fact that it helps explain why so many dinosaur
fossils are found in unusual and contorted positions.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
undermine the theory presented above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Many fossils of large mammals are found in
contorted positions.
Angiosperms provide a great deal of nutrition.
Carnivorous dinosaurs mostly ate other,
vegetarian, dinosaurs that fed on angiosperms.
Some poisonous plants do not produce aminoacid-based alkaloids.
Mammals sometimes die of drug overdoses from
eating angiosperms.

(D)
(E)

Since different parts of the transportation
infrastructure are the responsibility of different
levels of government, radical reconstruction
projects are very difﬁcult to coordinate
efﬁciently.
When funds for transportation infrastructure
maintenance are scarce, they are typically
distributed in proportion to the amount of
trafﬁc that is borne by different elements of the
infrastructure.
If continuous maintenance is performed at
less-than-adequate levels, the need for radical
reconstruction will often arise later than if
maintenance had been restricted to responding
to emergencies.
Radical reconstruction projects are, in general,
too costly to be paid for from current revenue.
For long periods, the task of regular maintenance
lacks urgency, since the consequences of
neglecting it are very slow to manifest
themselves.

21. A good way to get over one’s fear of an activity one
ﬁnds terrifying is to do it repeatedly. For instance, over
half of people who have parachuted only once report
being extremely frightened by the experience, while
less than 1 percent of those who have parachuted ten
times or more report being frightened by it.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)

takes for granted that the greater the number of
dangerous activities one engages in the less one
is frightened by anyone of them
neglects to consider those people who have
parachuted more than once but fewer than ten

takes for granted that people do not know how
frightening something is unless they have tried

22. Most economists believe that reducing the price of any
product generally stimulates demand for it. However,
most wine merchants have found that reducing the price
of domestic wines to make them more competitive
with imported wines with which they were previously
comparably priced is frequently followed by an increase
in sales of those imported wines.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
reconcile the belief of most economists with the
consequences observed by most wine merchants?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Economists’ studies of the prices of grocery
items and their rates of sales rarely cover
alcoholic beverages.
Few merchants of any kind have detailed
knowledge of economic theories about the
relationship between item prices and sales rates.
Consumers are generally willing to forgo
purchasing other items they desire in order to
purchase a superior wine.
Imported wines in all price ranges are
comparable in quality to domestic wines that
cost less.
An increase in the demand for a consumer
product is compatible with an increase in
demand for a competing product.

23. Certain bacteria that produce hydrogen sulﬁde as a
waste product would die if directly exposed to oxygen.
The hydrogen sulﬁde reacts with oxygen, removing
it and so preventing it from harming the bacteria.
Furthermore, the hydrogen sulﬁde tends to kill other
organisms in the area, thereby providing the bacteria
with a source of food. As a result, a dense colony of
these bacteria produces for itself an environment in
which it can continue to thrive indeﬁnitely.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

A dense colony of the bacteria can indeﬁnitely
continue to produce enough hydrogen sulﬁde to
kill other organisms in the area and to prevent
oxygen from harming the bacteria.
The hydrogen sulﬁde produced by the bacteria
kills other organisms in the area by reacting
with and removing oxygen.
Most organisms, if killed by the hydrogen sulﬁde
produced by the bacteria, can provide a source
of food for the bacteria.
The bacteria can continue to thrive indeﬁnitely
only in an environment in which the hydrogen
sulﬁde they produce has removed all oxygen
and killed other organisms in the area.
If any colony of bacteria produces hydrogen
sulﬁde as a waste product, it thereby ensures
that it is both provided with a source of food
and protected from harm by oxygen.

inequities and sufferings of the present are replaced by
more harmonious and rational social arrangements will
always ﬁnd enthusiastic buyers. Since gloomy books

The questionable pattern of reasoning in which one of
the following arguments is most similar to that in the
argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Art that portrays people as happy and contented
has a tranquilizing effect on the viewer, an
effect that is appealing to those who are tense or
anxious. Thus, people who dislike such art are
neither tense nor anxious.
People who enjoy participating in activities such
as ﬁshing or hiking may nevertheless enjoy
watching such spectator sports as boxing or
football. Thus, one cannot infer from someone’s
participating in vigorous contact sports that he
or she is not also fond of less violent forms of
recreation.
Action movies that involve complicated and
dangerous special-effects scenes are enormously
expensive to produce. Hence, since traditional
dramatic or comedic ﬁlms contain no such
scenes, it is probable that they are relatively
inexpensive to produce.
Adults usually feel a pleasant nostalgia

Many critics agree that the primary characteristic of
Senegalese ﬁlmmaker Ousmane Sembène’s work is its
sociopolitical commitment. Sembène was trained in
Moscow in the cinematic methods of socialist
realism, and he asserts that his ﬁlms are not meant
to entertain his compatriots, but rather to raise their
awareness of the past and present realities of their
society. But his originality as a ﬁlmmaker lies most
strikingly in his having successfully adapted ﬁlm,
originally a Western cultural medium, to the needs,
pace, and structures of West African culture. In
particular, Sembène has found within African oral
culture techniques and strategies that enable him to
express his views and to reach both literate and
nonliterate Senegalese viewers.
A number of Sembène’s characters and motifs can
be traced to those found in traditional West African
storytelling. The tree, for instance, which in countless
West African tales symbolizes knowledge, life, death,
and rebirth, is a salient motif in Emitaï. The trickster,
usually a dishonest individual who personiﬁes
antisocial traits, appears in Borom Sarret, Mandabi,
and Xala as a thief, a corrupted civil servant, and a
member of the elite, respectively. In fact, most of
Sembène’s characters, like those of many oral West
African narratives, are types embodying collective
ideas or attitudes. And in the oral tradition, these
types face archetypal predicaments, as is true, for
example, of the protagonist of Borom Sarret, who has
no name and is recognizable instead by his trade—he
is a street merchant—and by the difﬁculties he
encounters but is unable to overcome.
Moreover, many of Sembène’s ﬁlms derive their
structure from West African dilemma tales, the
outcomes of which are debated and decided by their
audiences. The open-endedness of most of his plots
reveals that Sembène similarly leaves it to his viewers
to complete his narratives: in such ﬁlms as Borom
Sarret, Mandabi, and Ceddo, for example, he
provides his spectators with several alternatives as
the ﬁlms end. The openness of his narratives is also
evidenced by his frequent use of freeze-frames, which
carry the suggestion of continued action.
Finally, like many West African oral tales,
Sembène’s narratives take the form of initiatory
journeys that bring about a basic change in the
worldview of the protagonist and ultimately, Sembène
hopes, in that of the viewer. His ﬁlms denounce
social and political injustice, and his protagonists’
social consciousness emerges from an acute self-

(55)

1.

consciousness brought about by the juxtaposition of
opposites within the ﬁlms’ social context: good versus
evil, powerlessness versus power, or poverty versus
wealth. Such binary oppositions are used analogously
in West African tales, and it seems likely that these
dialectical elements are related to African oral
storytelling more than, as many critics have supposed,
to the Marxist components of his ideology.
Which one of the following most accurately states the
main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Sembène’s originality as a ﬁlmmaker lies
in his adaptation of traditional archetypal
predicaments and open-ended plots, both of
which are derived from West African oral tales.
Many of the characters in Sembène’s ﬁlms
are variations on character types common to
traditional West African storytelling.
Sembène’s ﬁlms derive their distinctive
characteristics from oral narrative traditions
that had not previously been considered suitable
subject matter for ﬁlms.
Sembène’s ﬁlms give vivid expression to the
social and political beliefs held by most of the
Senegalese people.
Sembène’s ﬁlms are notable in that they
use elements derived from traditional West
African storytelling to comment critically on
contemporary social and political issues.

uses animals as symbols

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Several African novelists who draw upon the oral
traditions of West Africa use binary oppositions
as fundamental structures in their narratives,
even though they have not read Marxist theory.
Folklorists who have analyzed oral storytelling
traditions from across the world have found
that the use of binary oppositions to structure
narratives is common to many of these
traditions.
When he trained in Moscow, Sembène read
extensively in Marxist political theory and
worked to devise ways of synthesizing Marxist
theory and the collective ideas expressed in
West African storytelling.
Very few ﬁlmmakers in Europe or North America
make use of binary oppositions to structure their
narratives.
Binary oppositions do not play an essential
structuring role in the narratives of some ﬁlms
produced by other ﬁlmmakers who subscribe to
Marxist principles.

Readers, like writers, need to search for answers.
Part of the joy of reading is in being surprised, but
academic historians leave little to the imagination. The
perniciousness of the historiographic approach became
fully evident to me when I started teaching. Historians
require undergraduates to read scholarly monographs
that sap the vitality of history; they visit on students
what was visited on them in graduate school. They
assign books with formulaic arguments that transform
history into an abstract debate that would have been
unfathomable to those who lived in the past. Aimed
so squarely at the head, such books cannot stimulate
students who yearn to connect to history emotionally
as well as intellectually.
In an effort to address this problem, some historians
have begun to rediscover stories. It has even become
something of a fad within the profession. This year, the
American Historical Association chose as the theme
for its annual conference some putative connection to
storytelling: “Practices of Historical Narrative.”
Predictably, historians responded by adding the word
“narrative” to their titles and presenting papers at
sessions on “Oral History and the Narrative of Class
Identity,” and “Meaning and Time: The Problem of
Historical Narrative.” But it was still historiography,
intended only for other academics. At meetings of
historians, we still encounter very few historians telling
stories or moving audiences to smiles, chills, or tears.

Writing is at the heart of the lawyer’s craft, and so,
like it or not, we who teach the law inevitably teach
aspiring lawyers how lawyers write. We do this in a few
stand-alone courses and, to a greater extent, through the
constraints that we impose on their writing throughout
the curriculum. Legal writing, because of the purposes
it serves, is necessarily ruled by linear logic, creating a
path without diversions, surprises, or reversals.
Conformity is a virtue, creativity suspect, humor
forbidden, and voice mute.
Lawyers write as they see other lawyers write, and,
inﬂuenced by education, profession, economic
constraints, and perceived self-interest, they too often
write badly. Perhaps the currently fashionable call for
attention to narrative in legal education could have an
effect on this. It is not yet exactly clear what role
narrative should play in the law, but it is nonetheless
true that every case has at its heart a story—of real
events and people, of concerns, misfortunes, conﬂicts,
feelings. But because legal analysis strips the human
narrative content from the abstract, canonical legal
form of the case, law students learn to act as if there is
no such story.
It may well turn out that some of the terminology
and public rhetoric of this potentially subversive
movement toward attention to narrative will ﬁnd its

way into the law curriculum, but without producing
corresponding changes in how legal writing is actually
taught or in how our future colleagues will write. Still,
even mere awareness of the value of narrative could

It will be a concise, well-crafted piece of writing
that summarizes most, if not all, of the facts that
are important in the case.
It will not genuinely convey the human
dimension of the case, regardless of how
accurate the document may be in its details.
It will neglect to make appropriate connections

Traditional theories of animal behavior assert that
animal conﬂict within a species is highly ritualized
and does not vary from contest to contest. This
species-speciﬁc model assumes that repetitive use of
the same visual and vocal displays and an absence
of escalated ﬁghting evolved to prevent injury. The
contestant that exhibits the “best” display wins the
contested resource. Galapagos tortoises, for instance,
settle contests on the basis of height: the ritualized
display consists of two tortoises facing one another
and stretching their necks skyward; the tortoise
perceived as being “taller” wins.
In populations of the spider Agelenopsis aperta,
however, ﬁghting behavior varies greatly from contest
to contest. In addition, ﬁghting is not limited to
displays: biting and shoving are common. Susan
Riechert argues that a recently developed model,
evolutionary game theory, provides a closer ﬁt to A.
aperta territorial disputes than does the speciesspeciﬁc model, because it explains variations in
conﬂict behavior that may result from varying
conditions, such as differences in size, age, and
experience of combatants. Evolutionary game theory
was adapted from the classical game theory that was
developed by von Neumann and Morgenstern to
explain human behavior in conﬂict situations. In both
classical and evolutionary game theory, strategies are
weighed in terms of maximizing the average payoff
against contestants employing both the same and
different strategies. For example, a spider may engage
in escalated ﬁghting during a dispute only if the
disputed resource is valuable enough to warrant the
risk of physical injury. There are, however, two major
differences between the classical and evolutionary
theories. First, whereas in classical game theory it is
assumed that rational thought is used to determine
which action to take, evolutionary game theory
assumes that instinct and long-term species advantage
ultimately determine the strategies that are exhibited.
The other difference is in the payoffs: in classical
game theory, the payoffs are determined by an
individual’s personal judgment of what constitutes
winning; in evolutionary game theory, the payoffs are
deﬁned in terms of reproductive success.
In studying populations of A. aperta in a
grassland habitat and a riparian habitat, Riechert
predicts that such factors as the size of the opponents,
the potential rate of predation in a habitat, and the
probability of winning a subsequent site if the dispute
is lost will all affect the behavior of spiders in
territorial disputes. In addition, she predicts that the
markedly different levels of competition for web sites
in the two habitats will affect the spiders’ willingness
to engage in escalated ﬁghting. In the grassland,
where 12 percent of the habitat is available for
occupation by A. aperta, Riechert predicts that
spiders will be more willing to engage in escalated
ﬁghting than in the riparian habitat, where 90 percent
of the habitat is suitable for occupation.

Evolutionary game theory and classical game
theory can be used to analyze the process of
decision-making used by humans and animals
in settling disputes.
A. aperta in grassland habitats and riparian
habitats exhibit an unusually wide variety of
ﬁghting behaviors in territorial disputes.
Evolutionary game theory may be useful in
explaining the behavior of certain spiders during
territorial disputes.
The traditional theory of animal behavior in
conﬂict situations cannot be used to explain the
ﬁghting behavior of most species.
Evolutionary game theory, adapted from classical
game theory, is currently used by scientists to

(D)
(E)

Spiders in the grassland habitat engage in
escalated ﬁghting when a disputed site is highly
desirable.
Spiders in the riparian habitat are not willing
to engage in escalated ﬁghting for less-than
suitable sites.
Spiders in the riparian habitat conﬁne their
ﬁghting to displays more regularly than do
spiders in the grassland habitat.
Spiders in the riparian habitat are as willing to
engage in escalated ﬁghting as are spiders in the
grassland habitat.
Spiders in the riparian habitat are more likely to
withdraw when faced with a larger opponent
in territorial disputes than are spiders in the
grassland habitat.

(A)

(B)

(C)

They exhibit variations in ﬁghting behavior
from contest to contest primarily because of the

displays if the value of a disputed resource is
too low and the risk of physical injury is too
great.
They exhibit variations in ﬁghting behavior that
are similar to those exhibited by members of
most other species of animals.
They are more likely to engage in escalated
ﬁghting during disputes than to limit their

Most people acknowledge that not all
governments have a moral right to govern and that
there are sometimes morally legitimate reasons for
disobeying the law, as when a particular law
prescribes behavior that is clearly immoral. It is also
commonly supposed that such cases are special
exceptions and that, in general, the fact that
something is against the law counts as a moral, as
well as legal, ground for not doing it; i.e., we
generally have a moral duty to obey a law simply
because it is the law. But the theory known as
philosophical anarchism denies this view, arguing
instead that people who live under the jurisdiction of
governments have no moral duty to those
governments to obey their laws. Some commentators
have rejected this position because of what they take
to be its highly counterintuitive implications: (1) that
no existing government is morally better than any
other (since all are, in a sense, equally illegitimate),
and (2) that, lacking any moral obligation to obey any
laws, people may do as they please without scruple.
In fact, however, philosophical anarchism does not
entail these claims.
First, the conclusion that no government is
morally better than any other does not follow from
the claim that nobody owes moral obedience to any
government. Even if one denies that there is a moral
obligation to follow the laws of any government, one
can still evaluate the morality of the policies and
actions of various governments. Some governments
do more good than harm, and others more harm than
good, to their subjects. Some violate the moral rights
of individuals more regularly, systematically, and
seriously than others. In short, it is perfectly
consistent with philosophical anarchism to hold that
governments vary widely in their moral stature.
Second, philosophical anarchists maintain that all
individuals have basic, nonlegal moral duties to one
another—duties not to harm others in their lives,
liberty, health, or goods. Even if governmental laws
have no moral force, individuals still have duties to
refrain from those actions that constitute crimes in the
majority of legal systems (such as murder, assault,
theft, and fraud). Moreover, philosophical anarchists
hold that people have a positive moral obligation to
care for one another, a moral obligation that they
might even choose to discharge by supporting
cooperative efforts by governments to help those in
need. And where others are abiding by established
laws, even those laws derived from mere conventions,
individuals are morally bound not to violate those
laws when doing so would endanger others. Thus, if
others obey the law and drive their vehicles on the
right, one must not endanger them by driving on the
left, for, even though driving on the left is not
inherently immoral, it is morally wrong to
deliberately harm the innocent.

20. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Some views that certain commentators consider
to be implications of philosophical anarchism
are highly counterintuitive.
Contrary to what philosophical anarchists
claim, some governments are morally superior
to others, and citizens under legitimate
governments have moral obligations to one
another.
It does not follow logically from philosophical
anarchism that no government is morally better
than any other or that people have no moral
duties toward one another.
Even if, as certain philosophical anarchists claim,
governmental laws lack moral force, people still
have a moral obligation to refrain from harming
one another.
Contrary to what some of its opponents have
claimed, philosophical anarchism does not
conﬂict with the ordinary view that one should
obey the law because it is the law.

21. The author identiﬁes which one of the following as a
commonly held belief?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

In most cases we are morally obligated to obey
the law simply because it is the law.
All governments are in essence morally equal.
We are morally bound to obey only those laws
we participate in establishing.
Most crimes are morally neutral, even though
they are illegal.
The majority of existing laws are intended to
protect others from harm.

22. The author’s stance regarding the theory of
philosophical anarchism can most accurately be
described as one of
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

ardent approval of most aspects of the theory
apparent acceptance of some of the basic
positions of the theory
concerned pessimism about the theory’s ability
to avoid certain extreme views
hesitant rejection of some of the central features
of the theory
resolute antipathy toward both the theory and
certain of its logical consequences

23. By attributing to commentators the view that
philosophical anarchism has implications that are
“counterintuitive” (line 17), the author most likely
means that the commentators believe that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the implications conﬂict with some commonly
held beliefs
there is little empirical evidence that the
implications are actually true
common sense indicates that philosophical
anarchism does not have such implications
the implications appear to be incompatible with
each other
each of the implications contains an internal
logical inconsistency

24. Which one of the following scenarios most completely
conforms to the views attributed to philosophical
anarchists in lines 37-44?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

A member of a political party that is illegal in a
particular country divulges the names of other
members because he fears legal penalties.
A corporate executive chooses to discontinue
her company’s practice of dumping chemicals
illegally when she learns that the chemicals are
contaminating the water supply.
A person who knows that a coworker has stolen
funds from their employer decides to do nothing
because the coworker is widely admired.
A person neglects to pay her taxes, even though
it is likely that she will suffer severe legal
penalties as a consequence, because she wants
to use the money to ﬁnance a new business.
A driver determines that it is safe to exceed the
posted speed limit, in spite of poor visibility,
because there are apparently no other vehicles
on the road.

25. It can be inferred that the author would be most likely
to agree that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

people are subject to more moral obligations than
is generally held to be the case
governments that are morally superior recognize
that their citizens are not morally bound to obey
their laws
one may have good reason to support the efforts
of one’s government even if one has no moral
duty to obey its laws
there are some sound arguments for claiming that
most governments have a moral right to require
obedience to their laws
the theory of philosophical anarchism entails
certain fundamental principles regarding how
laws should be enacted and enforced

26. The author’s discussion of people’s positive moral duty
to care for one another (lines 44-49) functions primarily
to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

demonstrate that governmental efforts to help
those in need are superﬂuous
suggest that philosophical anarchists maintain
that laws that foster the common good are
extremely rare
imply that the theoretical underpinnings of
philosophical anarchism are inconsistent with
certain widely held moral truths
indicate that philosophical anarchists recognize
that people are subject to substantial moral
obligations
illustrate that people are morally obligated to
refrain from those actions that are crimes in
most legal systems

27. In the passage, the author seeks primarily to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

describe the development and theoretical
underpinnings of a particular theory
establish that a particular theory conforms to the
dictates of common sense
argue that two necessary implications of a
particular theory are morally acceptable
defend a particular theory against its critics by
showing that their arguments are mistaken
demonstrate that proponents of a particular
theory are aware of the theory’s defects
