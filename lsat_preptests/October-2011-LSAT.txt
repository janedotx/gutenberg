SECTION I
Time—35 minutes
25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Sometimes it is advisable for a medical patient to seek a
second opinion. But this process can be awkward for
both the patient and the physicians, since the patient
often worries that the first physician will be alienated.
In addition, for the first physician there is the issue of
pride: a second opinion tacitly highlights a physician’s
fallibility. And the second physician is in the position of
evaluating not only a patient’s health, but also,
inevitably and uncomfortably, a colleague’s work.
Which one of the following most accurately states the
conclusion of the argument as a whole?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Because of the awkwardness involved, it is best
for patients not to seek second opinions unless
it is absolutely necessary.
In cases in which second opinions are necessary,
the first physician often feels that his or her
professional judgment is called into question.
The process of obtaining a second medical
opinion can be awkward for those involved.
Physicians who are called upon to offer second
opinions are always uncomfortable about
evaluating the work of colleagues.
In many cases in which medical patients seek
second opinions, they are concerned about
offending the first physician.

2. There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This
represents a very large increase over their numbers in
the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250
if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not
large enough to support any more of these animals,
however.
If the statements above are true, which one of the
following must also be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Some part of the panthers’ current habitat is
only of marginal quality.
If the population of Florida panthers ever
exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat,
their population will not be self-sustaining.
The population of Florida panthers will never
increase much beyond its current level.
Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat
than they did in the 1970s.

3. Political scientist: Efforts to create a more egalitarian
society are often wrongly criticized on the
grounds that total equality would necessarily
force everyone into a common mold. Equality is
presumed by such critics to require unacceptably
bland uniformity. But this is not so. By promoting
complementary human interests, a society can
achieve a greater and more prosperous equality
while enhancing rather than minimizing diversity.
The political scientist’s argument proceeds by
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

undermining a view by showing that its general
acceptance would lead to undesirable
consequences
rebutting an objection by attacking the
assumption on which it is said to be based
attacking a view by claiming that those who
propose it are motivated only by self-interest
claiming that whatever is true of a group must
be true of each of the members of the group
undermining an apparent counterexample to a
universal claim

4. Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic
back pain were divided into two groups. Small
magnets were applied to the backs of one group;
the other group received no treatment. Most of the
patients in the first group, but very few in the
second group, reported a significant reduction in
pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably
effective at relieving some back pain.
Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the
logically strongest counter to the physician’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A patient’s merely knowing that a treatment has
been applied can lead to improvement in his or
her condition.
Most physicians believe that medication relieves
chronic back pain more effectively than
magnets do.
No other experiments have been done showing
that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area
other than the back.
Some of the scientists who helped design the
experiment believed even before the
experiment that magnetic fields relieve back
pain, but they were not directly involved in
conducting the experiment.
There was wide variation in the specific causes
of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients
in the experiment.

5. Kennel club members who frequently discipline their
dogs report a higher incidence of misbehavior than do
members who rarely or never discipline their dogs.
We can conclude from this that discipline does not
improve dogs’ behavior; on the contrary, it encourages
misbehavior.
The argument is flawed in that it fails to consider the
possibility that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

dogs’ misbehavior is the cause of, rather than
the result of, frequent discipline
dogs learn from past experience how their
owners are likely to react to misbehavior
discipline does not cause misbehavior on the
part of animals other than dogs
kennel club members tend to be more skilled at
raising dogs than are other dog owners
kennel club members are more likely to use
discipline than are other dog owners

6.

The number of tornadoes recorded annually in
North America has more than tripled since 1953. Yet
meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting
the creation of tornadoes are unchanged.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes
were not well known to meteorologists before
1953.
The intensity of the average tornado is greater
now than it was in 1953.
The number of tornadoes recorded annually has
increased only slightly in the last five years.
The amount of property damage done by
tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953.
Many more citizens are helping authorities
detect tornadoes now than in 1953.

7. Recently, a report commissioned by a confectioners
trade association noted that chocolate, formerly
considered a health scourge, is an effective antioxidant
and so has health benefits. Another earlier claim was
that oily foods clog arteries, leading to heart disease, yet
reports now state that olive oil has a positive influence
on the circulatory system. From these examples, it is
clear that if you wait long enough, almost any food will
be reported to be healthful.
The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the
argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

relies on the truth of a claim by a source that is
likely to be biased
applies a general rule to specific cases to which
it does not pertain
bases an overly broad generalization on just a
few instances
takes for granted that all results of nutritional
research are eventually reported
fails to consider that there are many foods that
are reported to be unhealthful

8. According to the “bottom-up” theory of how ecosystems
are structured, the availability of edible plants is what
primarily determines an ecosystem’s characteristics since
it determines how many herbivores the ecosystem can
support, which in turn determines how many predators it
can support. This theory also holds that a reduction in
the number of predators will have little impact on the
rest of the ecosystem.
Which one of the following, if true, would provide
evidence against the bottom-up theory?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In an effort to build up the population of a rare
species of monkey on Vahique Island, monkeys
were bred in zoos and released into the wild.
However, the effort failed because the trees on
which the monkeys fed were also nearly extinct.
After hunting virtually eliminated predators on
Rigu Island, the population of many herbivore
species increased more than tenfold, causing
the density of plants to be dramatically reduced.
After many of the trees on Jaevix Island were
cleared, the island’s leaf-cutter ants, which
require a forested ecosystem, experienced a
substantial decrease in population, as did the
island’s anteaters.
After a new species of fern was introduced to
Lisdok Island, native ferns were almost
eliminated. However, this did not affect the
population of the herbivores that had eaten the
native ferns, since they also thrived on a diet
of the new fern.
Plants that are a dietary staple of wild pigs on
Sedif Island have flourished over the last three
decades, and the population of the pigs has not
changed much in spite of extensive hunting.

9. If a child is to develop healthy bones, the child’s diet
must include sufficient calcium. It therefore follows that
the diets of children who do not develop healthy bones
do not include sufficient calcium.
Flawed reasoning in which one of the following most
closely parallels the flawed reasoning in the argument
above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If bread is to have a firm crust, it must be
baked at the right temperature. It therefore
follows that bread that is not baked at the right
temperature will not have a firm crust.
A cake must contain the right amount of flour
in order to taste good. It therefore follows that
cakes that do not taste good do not contain the
right amount of flour.
The Bake-a-Thon, which is open to contestants
of all ages, has never been won by a person
under the age of 30. It therefore follows that
the winner of this year’s Bake-a-Thon will not
be under the age of 30.
Both yeast and baking powder can cause sweet
rolls to rise. It therefore follows that yeast can
always be substituted for baking powder in a
recipe for sweet rolls.
In recipe contests, there are always more
contestants in the pie category than there are
in the cake category. It therefore follows that
contestants generally have a better chance of
winning in the cake category than in the pie
category.

10. History provides many examples of technological
innovations being strongly resisted by people whose
working conditions without those innovations were
miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more
powerful determinant of human behavior than is the
desire for comfort or safety.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
undermines the reasoning in the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

People correctly believe that technological
innovations often cause job loss.
People are often reluctant to take on new
challenges.
Some examples of technological innovation
have been embraced by workers.
People tend to adapt easily to gradually
implemented technological innovations.
People correctly believe that technological
innovations almost always increase workers’
productivity.

11. In considering the fact that many people believe that
promotions are often given to undeserving employees
because the employees successfully flatter their
supervisors, a psychologist argued that although many
people who flatter their supervisors are subsequently
promoted, flattery generally is not the reason for their
success, because almost all flattery is so blatant that it is
obvious even to those toward whom it is directed.
Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the
psychologist’s conclusion to be properly drawn?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

People in positions of responsibility expect to
be flattered.
Official guidelines for granting promotion tend
to focus on merit.
Flattery that is not noticed by the person being
flattered is ineffective.
Many people interpret insincere flattery as
sincere admiration.
Supervisors are almost never influenced by
flattery when they notice it.

12. The government is being urged to prevent organizations
devoted to certain views on human nutrition from
advocating a diet that includes large portions of
uncooked meat, because eating uncooked meat can be
very dangerous. However, this purported fact does not
justify the government’s silencing the groups, for surely
the government would not be justified in silencing a
purely political group merely on the grounds that the
policies the group advocates could be harmful to some
members of society. The same should be true for
silencing groups with certain views on human nutrition.
Which one of the following principles most helps to
justify the reasoning in the argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

The government should not silence any group
for advocating a position that a significant
proportion of society believes to be beneficial.
The government ought to do whatever is in the
best interest of society.
One ought to advocate a position only if one
believes that it is true or would be beneficial.
The government ought not to silence an opinion
merely on the grounds that it could be harmful
to disseminate the opinion.
One ought to urge the government to do only
those things the government is justified in doing.

13. Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group
of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging
to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch
before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred
roughly the same number of injuries. This
indicates that stretching before jogging does not
help to prevent injuries.
Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken
the medical researcher’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

For both groups of joggers compared by the
scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during
the study was lower than the overall rate of
jogging injuries.
Among the joggers in the groups compared by
the scientists, many of those previously injured
while jogging experienced difficulty in their
efforts to perform stretches.
Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions,
and other mishaps on which the flexibility
resulting from stretching would have little if
any effect.
The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries,
the more likely he or she is to develop the
habit of performing stretches before jogging.
Studies have found that, for certain forms of
exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the
severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

14. Superconductor development will enable energy to be
transported farther with less energy lost in transit. This
will probably improve industrial productivity, for a
similar improvement resulted when oil and natural gas
replaced coal as the primary fossil fuels used in
North America. Shipping costs, a function of the
distance fossil fuels are shipped and the losses of material
in transit, decreased for factory owners at that time.
The claim that superconductor development will
probably improve industrial productivity plays which
one of the following roles in the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is a conclusion for which the claim that
shipping costs for fossil fuels are partly a
function of the losses of material in transit is
offered as partial support.
It is a generalization for which the claim that
superconductor development will enable energy
to be transported farther with less energy lost
in transit is offered as an illustration.
It is an assumption supporting the conclusion
that superconductor development will enable
energy to be transported farther with less
energy lost in transit.
It is a premise offered to support the claim that
oil and natural gas have replaced coal as the
primary fossil fuels used in North America.
It is cited as evidence that shipping costs are a
function of the distances fossil fuels are
shipped and the losses of material in transit.

15. The French novelist Colette (1873–1954) has been
widely praised for the vividness of her language. But
many critics complain that her novels are indifferent to
important moral questions. This charge is unfair. Each of
her novels is a poetic condensation of a major emotional
crisis in the life of an ordinary person of her time. Such
emotional crises almost invariably raise important moral
questions.

16. The view that every person is concerned exclusively
with her or his own self-interest implies that government
by consent is impossible. Thus, social theorists who
believe that people are concerned only with their
self-interest evidently believe that aspiring to democracy
is futile, since democracy is not possible in the absence
of government by consent.
The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the
argument
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

17. Archaeologist: The mosaics that were removed from
Zeugma, the ancient city now flooded by the
runoff from Turkey’s Birecik Dam, should have
been left there. We had all the information about
them that we needed to draw archaeological
conclusions, and future archaeologists studying
the site, who may not have access to our records,
might be misled by their absence.
Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to
justify the reasoning in the archaeologist’s argument?
(A)

Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?

(B)

(A)

(C)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Critics who suggest that Colette’s novels are
indifferent to great moral questions of her time
greatly underestimate her literary achievements.
A novel that poetically condenses a major
emotional crisis does not have to be indifferent
to the important moral questions raised by that
crisis.
To deserve the level of praise that Colette has
received, a novelist’s work must concern itself
with important moral questions.
The vividness of Colette’s language was not
itself the result of poetic condensation.
Colette’s purpose in poetically condensing
emotional crises in the lives of characters in
her novels was to explore some of the
important moral questions of her time.

infers merely from the fact of someone’s
holding a belief that he or she believes an
implication of that belief
infers that because something is true of a group
of people, it is true of each individual member
of the group
infers that because something is true of each
individual person belonging to a group, it is
true of the group as a whole
attempts to discredit a theory by discrediting
those who espouse that theory
fails to consider that, even if an argument’s
conclusion is false, some of the assumptions
used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless
be true

(D)

(E)

The only considerations that bear upon the
question of whether the mosaics should have
been removed are archaeological.
Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether
or not that site had been flooded at some time.
The materials used in the construction of a
mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is
examined in its original location.
Archaeological sites from which artifacts have
been removed rarely mislead archaeologists
who later study the site.
The removal of artifacts from archaeological
sites rarely has any environmental impact.

18. Traffic engineers have increased the capacity of the
Krakkenbak Bridge to handle rush-hour traffic flow.
The resultant increase in rush-hour traffic flow would
not have occurred had the city not invested in computer
modeling technology last year at the request of the city’s
mayor, and the city’s financial predicament would not
have been resolved if the traffic flow across the bridge
during rush hour had not been increased.
Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the information above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The city’s financial predicament would not have
been resolved had the city chosen a competing
computer modeling software package.
The city’s financial predicament would not have
been resolved had the city not invested in
computer modeling technology.
On an average day, more traffic crosses the
Krakkenbak Bridge this year as compared to
last year.
Traffic flow across the Krakkenbak Bridge
during rush hour would not have increased had
the city’s mayor not made investing in computer
modeling technology the highest budgetary
priority last year.
The city’s mayor was a proponent of investing
in computer modeling technology because of
the city’s need to increase traffic flow across
the Krakkenbak Bridge during rush hour.

19. Court analyst: Courts should not allow the use of DNA
tests in criminal cases. There exists considerable
controversy among scientific experts about how
reliable these tests are. Unless there is widespread
agreement in the scientific community about how
reliable a certain test is, it is unreasonable for the
courts to allow evidence based on that test.
The court analyst’s reasoning is flawed because it fails
to take into account that
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

courts have the authority to admit or exclude
any evidence irrespective of what experts have
to say about its reliability
the standard against which evidence in a criminal
case is measured should not be absolute certainty
experts may agree that the tests are highly
reliable while disagreeing about exactly how
reliable they are
data should not be admitted as evidence in a
court of law without scientific witnesses
having agreed about how reliable they are
there are also controversies about reliability of
evidence in noncriminal cases

now receive a special discount coupon. Members of the
club who have rented more than ten videos in the past
month can receive the discount coupon only at the
VideoKing location from which the member last rented
a movie. Members of the Frequent Viewers club who
have not rented more than ten videos in the past month
can receive the coupon only at the Main Street location.
Pat, who has not rented more than ten videos in the past
month, can receive the special discount coupon at the
Walnut Lane location of VideoKing.
If all of the statements above are true, which one of the
following must be true?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The only people who can receive the special
discount coupon at the Main Street location are
Frequent Viewers club members who have not
rented more than ten videos.
Some members of the Frequent Viewers club
have not rented more than ten videos.
Some members of the Frequent Viewers club
can receive the special discount coupon at
more than one location of VideoKing.
Some people who are not members of the
Frequent Viewers club can receive the special
discount coupon.
If Pat rents a movie from the Main Street
location, then she will not receive the special
discount coupon.

21. Game show winners choosing between two equally
desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more
expensive or the one with which they are more familiar.
Today’s winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally
desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He
will thus choose A, which is more expensive.
The reasoning in which one of the following is most
similar to the reasoning above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

With a book contract, an academic writer
receives either an advance or a guarantee of
royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance
for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive
a guarantee of royalties.
When entering this amusement park, children
always choose to take their first ride on either
the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on
the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine
would not have been standing near the Mouse
during her first half hour in the amusement park.
The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only
slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the
gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is
affected by Jupiter’s gravitational pull and
asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y
is the more eccentric of the two.
New students in this program must choose either
a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no
desire to take a class in either of those fields,
so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.
To avoid predators, rabbits will either double
back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover.
The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this
wildlife film is in a field that offers no
opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to
double back on the fox.

22. Microbiologist: Because heavy metals are normally
concentrated in sewage sludge during the sewage
treatment process, the bacteria that survive in the
sludge have evolved the unusual ability to resist
heavy-metal poisoning. The same bacteria also
show a strong resistance to antibiotics. This
suggests that the bacteria’s exposure to the heavy
metals in the sewage sludge has somehow
promoted their resistance to antibiotics.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the microbiologist’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics
are not resistant to heavy-metal poisoning
either.
Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free
of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar
to normal sewage, are generally resistant to
neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.
Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in
sewage sludge in which heavy metals are
concentrated contributes to their resistance to
heavy-metal poisoning.
Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations
of heavy metals almost always contains
significant concentrations of antibiotics.
Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in
sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal
poisoning and antibiotics.

23. Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love
“until death do us part.” If “love” here refers to a
feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for
feelings are not within one’s control, and a promise
to do something not within one’s control makes
no sense. Thus, no one—including those making
marital vows—should take “love” in this context
to be referring to feelings.
The ethicist’s conclusion follows logically if which one
of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

None of our feelings are within our control.
People should not make promises to do
something that is not within their control.
“Love” can legitimately be taken to refer to
something other than feelings.
Promises should not be interpreted in such a
way that they make no sense.
Promises that cannot be kept do not make any
sense.

24. Principle: If a food product contains ingredients whose
presence most consumers of that product would
be upset to discover in it, then the food should be
labeled as containing those ingredients.
Application: Crackly Crisps need not be labeled as
containing genetically engineered ingredients,
since most consumers of Crackly Crisps would
not care if they discovered that fact.
The application of the principle is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that it
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

fails to address the possibility that consumers of
a specific food may not be representative of
consumers of food in general
fails to address the possibility that the genetically
engineered ingredients in Crackly Crisps may
have been proven safe for human consumption
implicitly makes use of a value judgment that is
incompatible with the principle being applied
takes for granted that if most consumers of a
product would buy it even if they knew
several of the ingredients in it, then they
would buy the product even if they knew all
the ingredients in it

certain action should be taken with a claim that
the action need not be taken in the absence of
those conditions

25. Editorial: The town would not need to spend as much as
it does on removing trash if all town residents
sorted their household garbage. However, while
telling residents that they must sort their garbage
would get some of them to do so, many would
resent the order and refuse to comply. The current
voluntary system, then, is to be preferred, because
it costs about as much as a nonvoluntary system
would and it does not engender nearly as much
resentment.
The contention that the town would not have to spend
as much as it does on removing trash if all town
residents sorted their garbage plays which one of the
following roles in the editorial’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

It is a claim that the editorial is trying to show
is false.
It is a fact granted by the editorial that lends
some support to an alternative to the practice
that the editorial defends as preferable.
It is an example of a difficulty facing the claim
that the editorial is attempting to refute.
It is a premise that the editorial’s argument
relies on in reaching its conclusion.
It is the conclusion that the editorial’s argument
purports to establish.

useful to draw a rough diagram. Choose the response that most accurately and completely answers each question and blacken
the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
Questions 1–6
An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new
employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and
Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the
following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two
employees can be assigned the same parking space. The
following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces:
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space
than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space
than Souza.
Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking
space than Young.
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or

Questions 7–12

A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela,
Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships
are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One
ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador
will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the
ambassadors must meet the following constraints:
Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one
of the ambassadorships.
If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships,
then so is Kayne.
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is
not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

Time—35 minutes
26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. “Hot spot” is a term that ecologists use to describe those
habitats with the greatest concentrations of species found
only in one place—so-called “endemic” species. Many
of these hot spots are vulnerable to habitat loss due to
commercial development. Furthermore, loss of endemic
species accounts for most modern-day extinctions.
Thus, given that only a limited number of environmental
battles can be waged, it would be reasonable for
organizations dedicated to preserving species to _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

try to help only those species who are threatened
with extinction because of habitat loss
concentrate their resources on protecting hot
spot habitats
treat all endemic species as equally valuable
and equally in need of preservation
accept that most endemic species will become
extinct
expand the definition of “hot spot” to include
vulnerable habitats that are not currently home
to many endangered species

2. Principle: If you sell an item that you know to be defective,
telling the buyer that the item is sound, you
thereby commit fraud.
Application: Wilton sold a used bicycle to Harris,
knowing very little about its condition. Wilton
told Harris that the bicycle was in good working
condition, but Harris soon learned that the brakes
were defective. Wilton was therefore guilty of fraud.
The application of the principle is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

the application fails to establish whether Wilton
was given the opportunity to repair the brakes
the application fails to indicate how much money
Wilton received for the bicycle
the application uses the word “defective” in a
sense that is crucially different from how it is
used in the statement of the principle
Harris might not have believed Wilton’s statement
about the bicycle’s condition
asserting something without justification is
not the same as asserting something one
knows to be false

3. Engine noise from boats travelling through killer
whales’ habitats ranges in frequency from 100 hertz to
3,000 hertz, an acoustical range that overlaps that in
which the whales communicate through screams and
squeals. Though killer whales do not seem to behave
differently around running boat engines, engine noise
from boats can be loud enough to damage their hearing
over time. Therefore, _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

younger killer whales are better able to tolerate
engine noise from boats than older whales are
killer whales are less likely to attempt to
communicate with one another when boat
engines are operating nearby
noise from boat engines may impair killer
whales’ ability to communicate
killer whales are most likely to prefer areas
where boat traffic is present, but light
killer whales would probably be more
successful in finding food if boats did not
travel through their habitats

4. Journalist: A manufacturers’ trade group that has long
kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent
me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing
companies. A representative of the trade group
later confirmed that every company listed in the
document does indeed belong to the trade group.
Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the
document, it is evidently not a member of the
trade group.
The journalist’s reasoning in the argument is flawed in
that the journalist
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries
would want to belong to the trade group
does not present any evidence that the document
names every member of the trade group
does not explain how it is that the trade group
could have inadvertently sent out a secret
document

6. Local resident: An overabundance of algae must be
harmful to the smaller fish in this pond. During
the fifteen or so years that I have lived here, the
few times that I have seen large numbers of dead
small fish wash ashore in late summer coincide
exactly with the times that I have noticed
abnormally large amounts of algae in the water.
The local resident’s argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that it
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

presumes, without providing justification, that
smaller fish are somehow more susceptible to
harm as a result of overabundant algae than
are larger fish
fails to consider that the effects on smaller
fish of overabundant algae may be less severe
in larger bodies of water with more diverse
ecosystems
ignores the possibility that the same cause
might have different effects on fish of
different sizes
ignores the possibility that the overabundance
of algae and the deaths of smaller fish are
independent effects of a common cause
ignores the possibility that below-normal
amounts of algae are detrimental to the pond’s
smaller fish

7. Tanner: The public should demand political debates
before any election. Voters are better able to
choose the candidate best suited for office if
they watch the candidates seriously debate one
another.
Saldana: Political debates almost always benefit the
candidate who has the better debating skills.
Thus, they don’t really help voters determine
which candidate is most qualified for office.
The dialogue provides the most support for the claim
that Tanner and Saldana disagree over which one of
the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Political candidates with strong debating skills
are more likely to win elections than those
with weak debating skills.
A voter who watches a political debate will
likely be better able, as a result, to determine
which candidate is more qualified for office.
Debating skills are of little use to politicians in
doing their jobs once they are elected to office.
The candidates with the best debating skills are
the ones who are most qualified for the political
offices for which they are running.
Political debates tend to have a major effect on
which candidate among those participating in
a debate will win the election.

8. A recent study shows that those highways that carry the
most traffic, and thus tend to be the most congested,
have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the phenomenon described above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Drivers have more accidents when they
become distracted.
The highways that have the highest rate of fatal
accidents have moderate volumes of traffic.
Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled
highways tend to be commuting to or from work.
Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are
moving at a high rate of speed.
Heavily traveled highways do not always carry
a higher proportion of large trucks.

9. In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted
sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft
that is identical to the one they have mandated for
bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions
evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be
equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
strengthen the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for
crimes that are proportional to the harm they
believe to result from those crimes.
In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of
harm resulting from an act in determining
whether to make that act illegal.
Often, in response to the unusually great harm
resulting from a particular instance of a crime,
lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty
for that crime.
In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no
more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that
are proportional to the harm resulting from
those crimes, crime in those lawmakers’
jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.

10. People often admonish us to learn the lessons of history,
but, even if it were easy to discover what the past was
really like, it is nearly impossible to discover its lessons.
We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of
World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to
discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever
apply them, for we shall never again have a situation
just like World War I.
That we should learn the lessons of history figures in
the argument in which one of the following ways?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It sets out a problem the argument as a whole
is designed to resolve.
It is compatible with accepting the argument’s
conclusion and with denying it.
It is a position that the argument simply takes
for granted is false.
It expresses the position the argument as a
whole is directed toward discrediting.
It is an assumption that is required in order to
establish the argument’s conclusion.

11. Sigerson argues that the city should adopt ethical
guidelines that preclude its politicians from accepting
campaign contributions from companies that do business
with the city. Sigerson’s proposal is dishonest, however,
because he has taken contributions from such companies
throughout his career in city politics.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

confuses a sufficient condition for adopting
ethical guidelines for politicians with a
necessary condition for adopting such guidelines
rejects a proposal on the grounds that an
inadequate argument has been given for it
fails to adequately address the possibility that
other city politicians would resist Sigerson’s
proposal
rejects a proposal on the grounds that the person
offering it is unfamiliar with the issues it raises
overlooks the fact that Sigerson’s proposal
would apply only to the future conduct of
city politicians

12. Some gardening books published by Garden Path Press
recommend tilling the soil and adding compost before
starting a new garden on a site, but they do not explain
the difference between hot and cold composting. Since
any gardening book that recommends adding compost
is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of
composting, some books published by Garden Path
are flawed.
The argument requires the assumption that
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

some gardening books that recommend tilling
the soil and adding compost before starting a
new garden are not flawed
gardeners should not add compost to the soil

13. Astronomers have found new evidence that the number
of galaxies in the universe is not 10 billion, as previously
believed, but 50 billion. This discovery will have an
important effect on theories about how galaxies are
formed. But even though astronomers now believe
40 billion more galaxies exist, many astronomers’
estimates of the universe’s total mass remain
virtually unchanged.
Which one of the following, if true, does most to
explain why the estimates remain virtually unchanged?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only
a tiny percentage of the universe’s total mass.
The overwhelming majority of galaxies are so
far from Earth that their mass can be only
roughly estimated.
The number of galaxies that astronomers believe
exist tends to grow as the instruments used to
detect galaxies become more sophisticated.
Theories about how galaxies are formed are
rarely affected by estimates of the universe’s
total mass.
There is no consensus among astronomers on
the proper procedures for estimating the
universe’s total mass.

14. Newspaper subscriber: Arnot’s editorial argues that
by making certain fundamental changes in
government we would virtually eliminate our
most vexing social ills. But clearly this
conclusion is false. After all, the argument Arnot
makes for this claim depends on the dubious
assumption that government can be trusted to
act in the interest of the public.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
a flaw in the argument’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

it repudiates a claim merely on the grounds that
an inadequate argument has been given for it
it treats a change that is required for virtual
elimination of society’s most vexing social ills
as a change that will guarantee the virtual
elimination of those ills
it fails to consider that, even if an argument’s
conclusion is false, some of the assumptions
used to justify that conclusion may
nonetheless be true
it distorts the opponent’s argument and then
attacks this distorted argument
it uses the key term “government” in one
sense in a premise and in another sense in
the conclusion

15. Columnist: Shortsighted motorists learn the hard way
about the wisdom of preventive auto maintenance;
such maintenance almost always pays off in the
long run. Our usually shortsighted city council
should be praised for using similar wisdom when
they hired a long-term economic development
adviser. In hiring this adviser, the council made
an investment that is likely to have a big payoff
in several years. Other cities in this region that
have devoted resources to economic
development planning have earned large
returns on such an investment.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
columnist’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Even some cars that receive regular preventive
maintenance break down, requiring costly repairs.
The columnist’s city has a much smaller
population and economy than the other cities
did when they began devoting resources to
economic development planning.
Most motorists who fail to perform preventive
maintenance on their cars do so for
nonfinancial reasons.
Qualified economic development advisers
generally demand higher salaries than many
city councils are willing to spend.
Cities that have earned large returns due to
hiring economic development advisers did
not earn any returns at all in the advisers’
first few years of employment.

16. Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is
annoying to other passengers. This suggests that
recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on
airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be
far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses
and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed
in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended
by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates,
they often cannot move to another seat.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the editorial’s argument by the
statement that cell-phone use would be far more
upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

It is the main conclusion of the argument.
It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
It is a premise that indirectly supports the main
conclusion of the argument by supporting a
premise for that conclusion.
It is a conclusion for which support is provided
and that itself is used in turn to directly
support the argument’s main conclusion.
It provides background information that plays
no role in the reasoning in the argument.

17. Science writer: The deterioration of cognitive faculties
associated with Alzheimer’s disease is evidently
caused by the activities of microglia—the brain’s
own immune cells. For one thing, this deterioration
can be slowed by some anti-inflammatory drugs,
such as acetylsalicylic acid. Furthermore, patients
with Alzheimer’s are unable to eliminate the
protein BA from the brain, where it accumulates
and forms deposits. The microglia attack these
protein deposits by releasing poisons that destroy
surrounding healthy brain cells, thereby impairing
the brain’s cognitive functions.

18. Lawyer: One is justified in accessing information in
computer files without securing authorization
from the computer’s owner only if the computer
is typically used in the operation of a business.
If, in addition, there exist reasonable grounds for
believing that such a computer contains data
usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against
the computer’s owner, then accessing the data in
those computer files without the owner’s
authorization is justified.
The principles stated by the lawyer most strongly
support which one of the following judgments?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
support the science writer’s argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The inability of Alzheimer’s patients to eliminate
the protein BA from the brain is due to a
deficiency in the brain’s immune system.
Acetylsalicylic acid reduces the production of
immune cells in the brain.
The activity of microglia results in a decrease
in the buildup of protein deposits in the brain.
The protein BA directly interferes with the
cognitive functions of the brain.
Immune reactions by microglia occur in certain
diseases of the brain other than Alzheimer’s.

(E)

Rey gave his friend Sunok a key to the store
where he worked and asked her to use the
store owners’ computer to look up their friend
Jim’s phone number, which Rey kept on the
computer. Because Sunok had Rey’s
permission, her action was justified.
Police department investigators accessed the
electronic accounting files of the central
computer owned by a consulting firm that was
on trial for fraudulent business practices
without seeking permission from the firm’s
owners. Contrary to the investigators’ reasonable
beliefs, however, the files ultimately provided
no evidence of wrongdoing. Nevertheless, the
investigators’ action was justified.
A police officer accessed, without Natalie’s
permission, files on the computer that Natalie
owned and used exclusively in the operation
of her small business. Since the police officer’s
search of the files on Natalie’s computer
produced no evidence usable in any legal
proceeding against Natalie, the police officer’s
action was clearly not justified.
Customs officials examined all of the files
stored on a laptop computer confiscated from
an importer whom they suspected of smuggling.
Because there were reasonable grounds for
believing that the computer had typically been
used in the operation of the importer’s
legitimate business, the customs officials’
action was justified.
Against the company owner’s wishes, a police
officer accessed some of the files on one of the
company’s computers. Although the computer
was typically used in the operation of the
company’s business, the particular files accessed
by the police officer were personal letters
written by one of the company’s employees.
Thus, the police officer’s unauthorized use of
the computer was not justified.

19. The conventional process for tanning leather uses large
amounts of calcium oxide and sodium sulfide. Tanning
leather using biological catalysts costs about the same as
using these conventional chemicals if the cost of waste
disposal is left out of the comparison. However, nearly
20 percent less waste is produced with biological
catalysts, and waste disposal is a substantial part of the
overall cost of tanning. It is therefore less costly to tan
leather if biological catalysts are used instead.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Leather tanned using the conventional process
is not lower in quality than is leather tanned
using biological catalysts.
The biological catalysts that can be used in the
tanning process are less costly by weight than
are calcium oxide and sodium sulfide.
New technological innovations have recently
made the use of biological catalysts in the
tanning process much more cost effective.
Disposal of tanning waste produced with
biological catalysts does not cost significantly
more than disposal of the same amount of
waste produced with the conventional process.
The labor costs associated with tanning leather
using biological catalysts are not any greater
than the labor costs associated with the
conventional tanning process.

20. One should not play a practical joke on someone if it
shows contempt for that person or if one believes it
might bring significant harm to that person.
The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify
the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

I should not have played that practical joke on
you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous,
I should have realized that it would bring
significant harm to someone.
I have no reason to think that the practical joke
I want to play would harm anyone. So, since
the joke would show no contempt for the
person the joke is played on, it would not be
wrong for me to play it.
Because of the circumstances, it would be
wrong for me to play the practical joke I had
intended to play on you. Even though it would
not show contempt for anyone, it could easily
bring you significant harm.
It would have been wrong for me to play the
practical joke that I had intended to play on
you. Even though I did not have reason to
think that it would significantly harm anyone,
I did think that it would show contempt for
someone.
Someone was harmed as a result of my
practical joke. Thus, even though it did not
show contempt for the person I played the joke
on, I should not have played it.

21. Economics professor: Marty’s Pizza and Checkers Pizza
are the two major pizza parlors in our town.
Marty’s sold coupon books including coupons
good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza
parlor, at Marty’s expense. But Checkers refused
to accept these coupons, even though they were
redeemed by all other local pizza parlors.
Accepting them would have cost Checkers
nothing and would have satisfied those of its
potential customers who had purchased the
coupon books. This shows that Checkers’s
motive in refusing to accept the coupons was
simply to hurt Marty’s Pizza.
Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the
economics professor’s conclusion to be properly drawn?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Any company that refuses to accept coupons
issued by a competitor when doing so would
satisfy some of the company’s potential
customers is motivated solely by the desire to
hurt that competitor.
Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor
by refusing to accept coupons issued by that
competitor will refuse to accept them even
when accepting them would cost nothing and
would satisfy its potential customers.
At least one company has refused to accept
coupons issued by its major local competitor
simply in order to hurt that competitor, even
though those coupons were accepted by all
other local competitors.
Any company that accepts its major competitor’s
coupons helps its competitor by doing so,
even if it also satisfies its own actual or
potential customers.
If accepting coupons issued by a competitor
would not enable a company to satisfy its
actual or potential customers, then that
company’s refusal to accept the coupons is
motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

22. Science writer: Scientists’ astounding success rate with
research problems they have been called upon to
solve causes the public to believe falsely that
science can solve any problem. In fact, the problems
scientists are called upon to solve are typically
selected by scientists themselves. When the
problems are instead selected by politicians or
business leaders, their formulation is nevertheless
guided by scientists in such a way as to make
scientific solutions feasible. Scientists are almost
never asked to solve problems that are not subject
to such formulation.
The science writer’s statements, if true, most strongly
support which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If a problem can be formulated in such a way
as to make a scientific solution feasible,
scientists will usually be called upon to solve
that problem.
Any problem a scientist can solve can be
formulated in such a way as to make a
scientific solution feasible.
Scientists would probably have a lower success
rate with research problems if their grounds for
selecting such problems were less narrow.
Most of the problems scientists are called upon
to solve are problems that politicians and
business leaders want solved, but whose
formulation the scientists have helped to guide.
The only reason for the astounding success rate
of science is that the problems scientists are
called upon to solve are usually selected by
the scientists themselves.

following arguments is most similar to that in the
argument above?
(A)

(B)

During times of the year when automobile
traffic increases, gas prices also increase.
Increases in gas prices lead to increases in
consumer complaints. Thus, increased
automobile traffic causes increased consumer

The most common species of birds in this region
are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds
have left this region by the end of November.
Hence, few birds remain in this region during
the winter.
It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in
this region are issued to drivers of sports cars.
After all, most drivers who are not interested
in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
Most nature photographers find portrait
photography boring. Moreover, most portrait
photographers especially enjoy photographing
dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers
find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care
services during the summer. Also, most
companies that run lawn-care services during
the summer hire additional workers in the
summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies
hire additional workers in the summer.

24. If one wants to succeed, then one should act as though
one were genuinely confident about one’s abilities, even
if one actually distrusts one’s skills. Success is much
more easily obtained by those who genuinely believe
themselves capable of succeeding than by those filled
with self-doubts.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
strengthens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Those who convince others that they are capable
of succeeding usually have few self-doubts.
Genuine confidence is often a by-product of
pretended self-confidence.
Success is usually more a matter of luck or
determination than of skill.
Many people who behave in a self-confident
manner are genuinely confident about their
abilities.
Self-doubt can hamper as well as aid the
development of the skills necessary for success.

pros and cons of a product one might purchase would
clearly be difficult and expensive. It is rational not to
acquire such information unless one expects that the
benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty
of doing so. Therefore, consumers who do not bother to
acquire such information are thereby behaving rationally.

The benefits of acquiring detailed information
about a product one might purchase usually do

Determining the most effective way to deter
deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive
crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently
being debated in the legal community. On one side of
the debate are those scholars who believe that
deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of
societal norms and institutions on individuals. These
scholars suggest that changing people’s beliefs about
crime, increasing the access of the most economically
alienated individuals to economic institutions, and
rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will
reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal
scholars who believe that the decision to commit a
deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual
choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and
penalties associated with criminal activity, along with
efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence
method. However, some recent legal scholarship has
changed the nature of this debate by introducing an
economic principle that shows that these two
positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly
complementary.
The economic principle that reconciles the two
positions is that of utility maximization, which holds
that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will
choose the action that maximizes their anticipated
overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected
utility of an action is ascertained by determining the
utilities of the possible outcomes of that action,
weighing them according to the likelihood of each
outcome’s coming to pass, and then adding up those
weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an
individual’s decision to commit a crime can be analyzed
as a rational economic choice.
According to the utility maximization principle a
person who responds rationally to economic incentives
or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected
utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught,
exceeds the expected utility from activity that is
lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence
methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the
recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence
debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen
law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of
detection and punishment and impose an increased
cost to the individual if detected and punished. This
lowers the expected utility from criminal activity,
thereby making a person less likely to choose to
commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on
the other side of the debate, such as increasing the
economic opportunities of individuals most alienated

(55)

from economic institutions, also affect the utility
equation. All else being equal, enacting these types
of policies will effectively increase the expected
utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis
demonstrates that the two positions are not
fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal
approach to crime deterrence would include elements
of both deterrence strategies.

1. Which one of the following most accurately states the
main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The principle of utility maximization provides
an economic framework that allows legal
scholars to analyze an individual’s decision to
commit a crime as a rational economic choice
that maximizes that individual’s expected utility.
Legal scholars have found that deliberate
criminal acts are motivated by neither external
influences nor individual choices alone but that
instead both of these factors are important in
the decision to commit a crime.
The utility maximization principle can be used
to quantify the effects both of methods of
deterrence that revolve around individual
factors and of those that emphasize the impact
of societal norms on the decision to commit a
deliberate crime.
Introduction of the utility maximization principle
into the current crime deterrence debate
indicates that both sides in the debate offer
useful recommendations that can work together
in deterring deliberate crime.
The utility maximization principle demonstrates
that deliberate criminal acts are the result of
the rational economic choices of individuals
and are not influenced by societal norms or the
policies and practices of societal institutions.

Mexican Americans share with speakers of
Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire
of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use.
The term “proverb” refers to a self-contained saying
that can be understood independent of a specific verbal
context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of
a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of
Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from
peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate
there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb
tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in
English-language proverbial speech.
Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose
meaning varies depending on the individual speaker
and the particular social context in which the use
occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that
proverb use is also shaped by the larger community
with which the individual interacts. The fact that
proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to
one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican
American communities: the instruction of the young.
In fact, this function seems to be much more
prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in
English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican
descent in the United States consistently report the
frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching
tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table
manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships.
The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of
proverb use within Mexican American communities:
one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example,
translates roughly as, “Tell me who you run with and
I’ll tell you who you are.” Perhaps this emphasis on
peer-group relations derives from a sense that
traditional, community-approved norms are threatened
by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from
a sense that, in dealing with older children especially,
parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster
their authority.
Another dimension of proverb use within
Mexican American communities is that proverbs often
serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of
membership in a particular ethnic group possessing
features that distinguish it from other groups within a
multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American
proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose
nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of
both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in
these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of
Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs
thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American
young people’s familiarity with their heritage, thereby
strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

7. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The Mexican American tradition of
Spanish-language proverb use differs in
important ways from the common proverb
tradition of Europe.
Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently
in Mexican American communities, where
they are used both to instruct the young and
to promote the young’s familiarity with their
heritage.
Most proverbs that are commonly used in
Mexican American communities have their
origins in either peninsular Spain or the
common proverb tradition of Europe.
Many people in Mexican American communities
use proverbs to teach young people about a
wide range of social behaviors and norms.
As is illustrated in the Spanish-language
tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide
range of purposes within a community.

Americans do proverbs function to maintain
ties to the traditions of those groups?
Is the use of proverbs in teaching young people
more common in Mexican American
communities than in the English-language
tradition?

10. The passage most strongly suggests which one of the
following about the use of proverbs?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce
community-approved norms.
The way in which a proverb is used depends,
at least in part, on the community in which it
is used.
The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican
American communities is for the purpose of
regulating peer-group relationships.
Proverbs are often used to help teach young
people languages.
When a proverb is used as an educational tool,
it is usually intended to serve more than one
purpose.

Europe.
Mexican American parents are more likely to
emphasize the value of traditional wisdom than
are most other parents in the United States.
There are more Spanish-language proverbs than
there are proverbs in the common proverb
tradition of Europe.
Proverb use in some communities may reflect
parental concern that the young will not
embrace traditional norms.
Most proverbs cannot be accurately translated
from one language to another.

12. Which one of the following is most strongly implied by
the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If a proverb is used to inculcate table manners,
then its primary purpose is to maintain ties to
an ethnic tradition.
The frequent use of proverbs within any
community functions, at least in part, to
convey a sense of their ethnicity to children
within that community.
The ways in which Mexican Americans use
Spanish-language proverbs are typical of the
ways in which Spanish speakers throughout the
world use those proverbs.
There are some sayings that do not require a
verbal context to be understood but whose
meaning for each particular use depends on the
social context in which that use occurs.
The emphasis within Mexican American
communities on teaching children about
peer-group relationships distinguishes those
communities from other communities within
the United States.

Passage A
Evolutionary psychology has taught us to examine
human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of
evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior
by examining how it contributes to the reproductive
success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and
thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material
responsible for causing that behavior. From an
evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a
thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of
behavior in which an individual expends energy or
other valuable resources promoting the welfare of
another individual?
The answer probably lies in the psychological
experiences of identification and empathy. Such
experiences could have initially arisen in response to
cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the
presence of shared genetic material in human
ancestors. The psychological states provoked by
these cues could have increased the chances of related
individuals’ receiving assistance, thereby enhancing
the survival and replication of genes influencing the
capacity for identification and empathy. This would
account, for example, for a mother’s rushing to help
her injured child; genes promoting their own
self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive
actions that appear unselfish.
Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based
groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the
entire group would have promoted the propagation of
the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later,
these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans
who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this
way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen
within a genetically “selfish” system.
Passage B
Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy
theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an
interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of
the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed,
is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your
unsurprising interest in your child’s well-being turns
out to be your genes’ conspiracy to propagate
themselves.
Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face
of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists,
an interest in the proliferation of genes explains
monogamous families in animals whose offspring
mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and,
at least in numerical terms, our species favors
monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists
take this as evidence that humans form monogamous
families because of our interest in propagating our
genes. Are they right?
Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference
needs to be handled with great care. There are, most
often, all sorts of interests that would explain any
given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive
that a particular interest explains a particular behavior
is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one
had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare:

(60)

(65)

an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too
would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate
one’s genes would explain promoting the welfare of
one’s children; but so too would an interest in the
welfare of one’s children. Not all of one’s motives can
be instrumental, after all; there must be some things
that one cares for just for their own sakes.

13. Which one of the following most accurately states the
main point of passage A?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Altruistic behavior is problematic for
evolutionary psychology because it tends to
diminish the reproductive success of individuals
that exhibit it.
New evidence may explain the evolution of
altruistic behavior in early humans by showing
that genes promote their own self-propagation.
Altruistic behavior originally served evolutionary
purposes that it does not serve today because
humans no longer live in small, kin-based
groups.
Contrary to what critics of evolutionary
psychology say, most significant types of
human behavior are prompted by genetically
selfish motivations.
An evolutionary explanation of altruistic
behavior may lie in the psychological states
brought about in early humans by cues of
kinship or familiarity.

14. The approaches toward evolutionary psychology
exhibited by the two authors differ in which one of the
following ways?
(A)

Any action performed by an early human was
necessarily orchestrated by that individual’s
genes to promote the genes’ self-propagation.
To explain a type of human behavior in
evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that
the behavior would have improved the
reproductive success of early humans.
Evolutionary psychology can be used to explain
human behavior but not animal behavior, since
animal behavior is driven largely by instinct.
Most early human behaviors that significantly
hindered reproductive success were eliminated
by evolutionary competition.

During Dostoyevsky’s time there were two
significant and opposing directions in Russian literary
criticism. One position maintained that art stood high
above the present and the everyday, while the radical
view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it
found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the
exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the
creation of a new society; literature, in other words,
should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position.
As a realist, he never doubted that reality was
literature’s crucial source. But his understanding of
reality went deeper than the one prevailing among
radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no
distinction in principle between fantasy and reality,
and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
The radical critics’ demand that reality be depicted
“as it is” was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality
was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced
it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for
me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries
of the so-called real world. Within perceptible “reality”
exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any
way superfluous to a writer’s concerns: “The fantastic
must be so intimately bound up with the real that one
almost believes in it.”
The radical critics’ insistence that art must serve a
particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the
equivalent of assigning to art “a shameful destiny.”
A literary work must stand or fall on its “artistic
merit,” he explained. The utilitarian claim that the
formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance
so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear
struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only
fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
But what does it mean to say that a work is “artistic”?
Dostoyevsky defined it thus: “To say that a novelist is
‘artistic’ means that he possesses a talent to express his
thoughts in characters and images so that when the
reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood
the author’s thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite
simply the ability to write well.”
The radical critics’ requirement that art must at all
costs be “useful” to people and society seemed to
Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what
will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance
how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No,
Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we
encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any
precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to
deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose
because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take
to become useful.

20. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

By drawing on elements from the two opposing
strains of Russian literary criticism, Dostoyevsky
developed the theoretical apparatus for a new
direction in Russian literature.
In opposition to the views of the two most
prominent groups of Russian literary critics,
Dostoyevsky believed that literature should
keep itself removed from reality.
Dostoyevsky’s indictment of the radical Russian
critics rested solely on his objection to the
radical critics’ stipulation that literature be
useful to society.
In his critical writings, Dostoyevsky championed
the freedom of the artist against the narrow
constraints imposed by the radical Russian
critics’ concern with the depiction of reality.
Dostoyevsky’s position on literature differed
sharply from that of the radical Russian critics
with respect to the nature of reality, the
importance of formal aspects in a literary
work, and the utility of art.

21. Which one of the following works most clearly
exemplifies writing Dostoyevsky would have deemed
“artistic”?

a fictionalized account based on interviews with
patients that illustrates the brutal facts of
illness
a novel in which the author’s ideas are given
substance through suitable characters and
events
a novel in which the author attempted to use
allegory to communicate a criticism of feudal
society
an autobiographical essay in which the author
chronicles the outstanding events in his life
a short story in which the characters debate how
to solve various social problems
