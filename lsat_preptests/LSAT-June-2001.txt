Most authoritarian rulers who undertake
democratic reforms do so not out of any intrinsic
commitment or conversion to democratic ideals, but
rather because they foresee or recognize that certain
changes and mobilizations in civil society make it
impossible for them to hold on indeﬁnitely to absolute
power.
Three major types of changes can contribute to a
society’s no longer condoning the continuation of
authoritarian rule. First, the values and norms in the
society alter over time, reducing citizens’ tolerance
for repression and concentration of power and thus
stimulating their demands for freedom. In some Latin
American countries during the 1970s and 1980s, for
example, this change in values came about partly as a
result of the experience of repression, which brought in
its wake a resurgence of democratic values. As people
come to place more value on political freedom and civil
liberties they also become more inclined to speak
out, protest, and organize for democracy, frequently
beginning with the denunciation of human rights
abuses.
In addition to changing norms and values, the
alignment of economic interests in a society can shift.
As one scholar notes, an important turning point in the
transition to democracy comes when privileged people
in society—landowners, industrialists, merchants,
bankers—who had been part of a regime’s support base
come to the conclusion that the authoritarian regime is
dispensable and that its continuation might damage
their long-term interests. Such a large-scale shift in
the economic interests of these elites was crucial in
bringing about the transition to democracy in the
Philippines and has also begun occurring incrementally
in other authoritarian nations.
A third change derives from the expanding
resources, autonomy, and self-conﬁdence of various
segments of society and of newly formed organizations
both formal and informal. Students march in the streets
demanding change; workers paralyze key industries;
lawyers refuse to cooperate any longer in legal
charades; alternative sources of information pierce and
then shatter the veil of secrecy and disinformation;
informal networks of production and exchange emerge
that circumvent the state’s resources and control. This
profound development can radically alter the balance of
power in a country, as an authoritarian regime that could
once easily dominate and control its citizens is placed
on the defensive.

Authoritarian rule tends in the long run to generate
all three types of changes. Ironically, all three types can
be accelerated by the authoritarian regime’s initial
success at producing economic growth and maintaining
social order—success that, by creating a period of
stability, gives citizens the opportunity to reﬂect on the
circumstances in which they live. The more astute or
calculating of authoritarian rulers will recognize this
and realize that their only hope of retaining some
power in the future is to match these democratic social
changes with democratic political changes.

1. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Authoritarian rulers tend to undertake democratic
reforms only after it becomes clear that the
nation’s economic and social power bases will
slow economic growth and disrupt social order
until such reforms are instituted.
Authoritarian regimes tend to ensure their own
destruction by allowing opposition groups
to build support among the wealthy whose
economic interests are easily led away from
support for the regime.
Authoritarian policies tend in the long run to
alienate the economic power base in a nation
once it becomes clear that the regime’s initial
success at generating economic growth and
stability will be short lived.
Authoritarian principles tend in the long run to
be untenable because they demand from the
nation a degree of economic and social stability
that is impossible to maintain in the absence of
democratic institutions.
Authoritarian rulers who institute democratic
reforms are compelled to do so because
authoritarian rule tends to bring about various
changes in society that eventually necessitate
corresponding political changes.

The term “blues” is conventionally used to refer to
a state of sadness or melancholy, but to conclude from
this that the musical genre of the same name is merely
an expression of unrelieved sorrow is to miss its deeper
meaning. Despite its frequent focus on such themes
as suffering and self-pity, and despite the censure that
it has sometimes received from church communities,
the blues, understood more fully, actually has much in
common with the traditional religious music known as
spirituals. Each genre, in its own way, aims to bring
about what could be called a spiritual transformation:
spirituals produce a religious experience and the blues
elicits an analogous response. In fact the blues has even
been characterized as a form of “secular spiritual.” The
implication of this apparently contradictory
terminology is clear: the blues shares an essential
aspect of spirituals. Indeed, the blues and spirituals
may well arise from a common reservoir of experience,
tapping into an aesthetic that underlies many aspects of
African American culture.
Critics have noted that African American folk
tradition, in its earliest manifestations, does not sharply
differentiate reality into sacred and secular strains or
into irreconcilable dichotomies between good and evil,
misery and joy. This is consistent with the apparently
dual aspect of the blues and spirituals. Spirituals, like
the blues, often express longing or sorrow, but these
plaintive tones are indicative of neither genre’s full
scope: both aim at transforming their participants’
spirits to elation and exaltation. In this regard, both
musical forms may be linked to traditional African
American culture in North America and to its ancestral
cultures in West Africa, in whose traditional religions
worshippers play an active role in invoking the
divine—in creating the psychological conditions that
are conducive to religious experience. These conditions
are often referred to as “ecstasy,” which is to be
understood here with its etymological connotation of
standing out from oneself, or rather from one’s
background psychological state and from one’s
centered concept of self.
Working in this tradition, blues songs serve to
transcend negative experiences by invoking the negative
so that it can be transformed through the
virtuosity and ecstatic mastery of the performer. This
process produces a double-edged irony that is often
evident in blues lyrics themselves; consider, for
example the lines “If the blues was money, I’d be a
millionaire,” in which the singer reconﬁgures the
experience of sorrow into a paradoxical asset through a
kind of boasting bravado. One critic has observed that
the impulse behind the blues is the desire to keep
painful experiences alive in the performer and audience
not just for their own sake, but also in order to coax
from these experiences a lyricism that is both tragic
and comic.

7.

Based on the passage, with which one of the following
statements would the author be most likely to agree?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

8.

The emphasis on spiritual transcendence takes
the blues out of the realm of folk art and into the
realm of organized religion.
Little of the transcendent aspect of the blues
is retained in its more modern, electronically
ampliﬁed, urban forms.
Other forms of African American folk art
rely heavily on uses of irony similar to those
observed in the blues.
The distinctive musical structure of blues songs
is the primary means of producing tensions
between sadness and transcendence.
The blues may be of psychological beneﬁt to its
listeners.

Each of the following is indicated by the passage as a
shared aspect of the blues and spirituals EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)

expressions of sorrow or longing
a striving to bring about a kind of spiritual
transformation

Two species of cacti, which are largely dissimilar,
have very similar ﬂowers; this has been proven
to be due to the one’s evolution from a third
species, whose ﬂowers are nonetheless quite
different from theirs.
Two species of ferns, which are closely similar in
most respects, have a subtly different
arrangement of stem structures; nevertheless,
they may well be related to a third, older
species, which has yet a different arrangement
of stem structures.
Two types of trees, which botanists have long
believed to be unrelated, should be reclassiﬁed
in light of the essential similarities of their
ﬂower structures and their recently discovered
relationship to another species, from which they
both evolved.
Two species of grass, which may have some
subtle similarities, are both very similar to a
third species, and thus it can be inferred that
the third species evolved from one of the two
species.
Two species of shrubs, which seem superﬁcially
unalike, have a signiﬁcantly similar leaf
structure; this may be due to their relation to a
third, older species, which is similar to both of
them.

In the eighteenth century the French naturalist Jean
Baptiste de Lamarck believed that an animal’s use or
disuse of an organ affected that organ’s development in
the animal’s offspring. Lamarck claimed that the
giraffe’s long neck, for example, resulted from its
ancestors stretching to reach distant leaves. But
because biologists could ﬁnd no genetic mechanism to
make the transmission of environmentally induced
adaptations seem plausible, they have long held that
inheritance of acquired characteristics never occurs.
Yet new research has uncovered numerous examples of
the phenomenon.
In bacteria, for instance, enzymes synthesize and
break down rigid cell walls as necessary to
accommodate the bacteria’s growth. But if an
experimenter completely removes the cell wall from a
bacterium, the process of wall synthesis and
breakdown is disrupted, and the bacterium continues to
grow—and multiply indeﬁnitely—without walls. This
inherited absence of cell walls in bacteria results from
changes in the interactions among genes, without any
attendant changes in the genes themselves.
A fundamentally different kind of environmentally
induced heritable characteristic occurs when speciﬁc
genes are added to or eliminated from an organism. For
example, a certain virus introduces a gene into fruit
ﬂies that causes the ﬂies to be vulnerable to carbon
dioxide poisoning, and fruit ﬂies infected with the virus
will pass the gene to their offspring. But if infected
ﬂies are kept warm while they are producing eggs, the
virus is eliminated from the eggs and the offspring are
resistant to carbon dioxide. Similarly, if an Escherichia
coli bacterium carrying a certain plasmid—a small ring
of genetic material—comes into contact with an E. coli
bacterium lacking the plasmid, the plasmid will enter
the second bacterium and become part of its genetic
makeup, which it then passes to its offspring. The case
of the E. coli is especially noteworthy for its suggestion
that inheritance of acquired characteristics may have
helped to speed up evolution: for example, many
complex cells may have ﬁrst acquired the ability to
carry out photosynthesis by coming into contact with a
bacterium possessing the gene for that trait, an ability
that normally would have taken eons to develop
through random mutation and natural selection.
The new evidence suggests that genes can be
divided into two groups. Most are inherited
“vertically,” from ancestors. Some, however, seem to
have been acquired “horizontally,” from viruses,
plasmids, bacteria, or other environmental agents The
evidence even appears to show that genes can be
transmitted horizontally between organisms that are
considered to be unrelated: from bacteria to plants, for
example, or from bacteria to yeast. Such horizontal
transmission may well be the mechanism for
inheritance of acquired characteristics that has long
eluded biologists, and that may eventually prove
Lamarck’s hypothesis to be correct.

13. The passage suggests that many biologists no longer
believe which one of the following?

When women are persecuted on account of their
gender, they are likely to be eligible for asylum.
Persecution is the linchpin of the deﬁnition of a refugee
set out in the United Nations Convention Relating to
the Status of Refugees. In this document, a refugee is
deﬁned as any person facing persecution “for reasons of
race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group, or political opinion.” While
persecution on the basis of gender is not explicitly
listed, this omission does not preclude victims of
gender-based persecution from qualifying as refugees,
nor does it reﬂect an intention that such persons be
excluded from international protection. Rather, women
persecuted on account of gender are eligible for asylum
under the category of “social group.” The history of the
inclusion of the social-group category in the deﬁnition
of a refugee indicates that this category was intended to
cover groups, such as women facing gender-based
persecution, who are otherwise not covered by the
deﬁnition’s speciﬁc categories.
The original deﬁnition of refugee, which came
from the constitution of the International Refugee
Organization, did not include social group. However,
the above-mentioned United Nations Convention added
the category in order to provide a “safety net” for
asylum-seekers who should qualify for refugee status
but who fail to fall neatly into one of the enumerated
categories. The drafters of the Convention intentionally
left the precise boundaries of the social-group category
undeﬁned to ensure that the category would retain the
ﬂexibility necessary to address unanticipated
situations.
A broad interpretation of social group is supported
by the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for
Determining Refugee Status (1979) published by the
ofﬁce of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR). The Handbook describes a social
group as persons of similar background, habits, or
social status. This expansive interpretation of the
category is resonant with the intentions of the
Convention drafters—a malleable category created for
future asylum determinations. Since many women
ﬂeeing gender-based persecution share a common
background and social status, they should fall within
the Handbook’s deﬁnition of a social group.
Furthermore, a 1985 UNHCR Executive Committee
report counseled member states to use the social-group
category to classify women asylum-seekers “who face
harsh or inhuman treatment due to their having
transgressed the social mores of the society in which
they live.”
Such a pronouncement is particularly signiﬁcant. A
position taken by an organization such as the UNHCR
is likely to exert a strong inﬂuence on the international
community. In particular, the UNHCR’s position is
likely to have an impact on the interpretation of
national asylum laws, since the terms and deﬁnitions
used in many national laws have been developed under
the international consensus that UNHCR represents.

19. According to the passage, which one of the following is
true about both the United Nations Convention and the
UNHCR Handbook?
Handbook
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Both documents are likely to exert a strong
inﬂuence on improving the status of women
in countries that are members of the United
Nations.
Both documents explicitly support granting
refugee status to women ﬂeeing gender-based
persecution.
Both documents recommend using the socialgroup category to classify women refugees
seeking asylum from persecution.
Both documents suggest that the social-group
category can be applied to a wide variety of
asylum-seekers.
Both documents describe a social group as
persons who share a similar background and
hold a similar status in society.

true about the drafters of the United Nations
Convention?

(E)

They wanted to ensure that the United Nations
would be consulted as new reasons for seeking
refugee status arose.
They followed the precedent set by the
International Refugee Organization concerning
the status of refugees seeking asylum from
gender-based persecution.
They recognized that it would be difﬁcult to list
every possible reason why a person might seek
refuge from persecution in the Convention’s
deﬁnition of a refugee.
They did not consider persecution on the basis of
gender to be as valid a reason for seeking
asylum as persecution on the basis of race,
nationality, or religion.
They did not list gender as a category in the
Convention’s deﬁnition of a refugee because
gender-based persecution was not a signiﬁcant
problem at the time the Convention was drafted.

It reﬂected an awareness that some groups of
refugees seeking asylum do not easily fall into
speciﬁc categories.
It established that a person’s social-group
membership may be as signiﬁcant a cause
of persecution as a person’s race, religion, or
nationality.
It prevented individual nations from refusing
asylum to persons who were clearly eligible for
such status on the basis of the deﬁnition.

international acceptance of the deﬁnition was
dependent on reaching consensus about what
constituted persecution
international concern about the number of people
ﬂeeing persecution was the primary force
behind the creation of the deﬁnition
persecution is a controversial term and it was
difﬁcult to reach international agreement about
its exact meaning
persecution is the primary reason why people are
forced to leave their home countries and seek
asylum elsewhere
persecution is the central factor in determining
whether a person is eligible for refugee status

25. The passage suggests that which one of the following is
most likely to be true of the relationship between
UNHCR documents concerning refugees and many
nations’ asylum laws?
(A)

23. The author of the passage would most likely agree
with which one of the following statements about
the deﬁnition of a refugee in the constitution of the
International Refugee Organization?
(A)

24. The author describes persecution as the “linchpin of the
deﬁnition of a refugee” (line 3) in order to indicate that

(D)

(E)

The terms and deﬁnitions in the United Nations
documents are frequently interpreted more
narrowly than are similar terms and deﬁnitions
in many national asylum laws.
Many of the speciﬁc terms and deﬁnitions in the
United Nations documents represent a
compilation of terms and deﬁnitions that were
ﬁrst used in national asylum laws.
A new interpretation of a term or deﬁnition in
one of the United Nations documents is likely
to inﬂuence the interpretation of a similar term
or deﬁnition in a national asylum law.
A change in the wording of a speciﬁc deﬁnition
in one of the United Nations documents
must also be reﬂected in any similar terms or
deﬁnitions contained in national asylum laws.
The terms and deﬁnitions used in many national
asylum laws are in direct opposition to the
terms and deﬁnitions used in the United Nations
documents.

In his new book on his complex scientiﬁc research, R
frequently imputes bad faith to researchers disagreeing
with him. A troubling aspect of R’s book is his stated
conviction that other investigators’ funding sources
often determine what “ﬁndings” those investigators
report. Add to this that R has often shown himself to
be arrogant, overly ambitious, and sometimes plain
nasty, and it becomes clear that R’s book does not merit

Having an efﬁcient, attractive subway system makes
good economic sense. So, the city needs to purchase
new subway cars, since the city should always do what
makes good economic sense.
The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The city should invest in an efﬁcient, attractive
subway system.
Cost-effective subway cars are an integral part of
an efﬁcient subway system.
Investment in new subway cars makes better
economic sense than many of the other
investment options open to the city.
New subway cars are ﬁnancially affordable.
New subway cars are required in order for the
city to have a subway system that is efﬁcient
and attractive.

For newborns of age four to six weeks whose mothers
have been the primary caregivers, the following is true:
When the newborns are crying due to hunger or other
similar discomfort, merely hearing the mother’s voice
will lead to a temporary halt in crying, while the voices
of others do not have this effect.
Which one of the following is most reasonably
supported by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

5.

Babies more easily learn to recognize the voices
of their mothers than the voices of other people.
A mother’s voice is the ﬁrst thing a baby learns
to recognize.
Babies associate the voice of the primary
caregiver with release from discomfort.
Often only a primary caregiver can provide
comfort to a newborn.
Discomfort in newborns is best relieved by
hearing the mother’s voice.

Many elementary schools have recently offered
computer-assisted educational programs. Students’
reactions after several years have been decidedly mixed.
Whereas students have found computers very useful
in studying arithmetic, they have found them of little
help in studying science, and of no help at all with their
reading and writing skills.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the students’ mixed reactions?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Students in these schools began reading and
doing arithmetic before learning to use
computers.
Of the disciplines and skills mentioned, the
exactness of arithmetic makes it most suitable to
computer-assisted education.
Many elementary school teachers are reluctant to
use computer technology in their classrooms.
Young students are more likely to maintain
interest in training programs that use the newest
computers and video graphics than in those that
do not.
The elementary schools have offered more
computer-assisted programs in reading and
writing than in arithmetic and science.

The notion that one might be justiﬁed in behaving
irrationally in the service of a sufﬁciently worthy end
is incoherent. For if such an action is justiﬁed, then one
would be behaving rationally, not irrationally.
Which one of the following arguments is most similar
in its reasoning to the argument above?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

A representative of the law, such as a judge or a
police ofﬁcer, ought not to commit crimes. For
if representatives of the law commit crimes,
they will be ineffective in preventing crime.
One cannot intend to spill a glass of water
accidentally. Spilling it accidentally means that
the act will not have been done intentionally.
One cannot live the good life and be unhappy. If

A certain moral system holds that performing good
actions is praiseworthy only when one overcomes a
powerful temptation in order to perform them. Yet this
same moral system also holds that performing good
actions out of habit is sometimes praiseworthy.
Which one of the following, if true, does the most to
reconcile the apparent conﬂict in the moral system
described above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

8.

People who perform good actions out of habit
have often acquired this habit after years of
having resisted temptation.
Most people face strong moral temptation from
time to time but few people have to endure it
regularly.
People virtually always perform actions they
think are good, regardless of what other people
may think.
Since it is difﬁcult to tell what is going on in
another person’s mind, it is often hard to know
exactly how strongly a person is tempted.
It is far more common for people to perform
good actions out of habit than for them to do so
against strong temptation.

Conservationist: The risk to airplane passengers from
collisions between airplanes using the airport and
birds from the wildlife refuge is negligible. In the
10 years since the refuge was established, only
20 planes have been damaged in collisions with
birds, and no passenger has been injured as a
result of such a collision. The wildlife refuge
therefore poses no safety risk.
Pilot: You neglect to mention that 17 of those 20
collisions occurred within the past 2 years, and
that the number of birds in the refuge is rapidly
increasing. As the number of collisions between
birds and airplanes increases, so does the
likelihood that at least one such collision will
result in passenger injuries.

A university study reported that between 1975 and 1983
the length of the average workweek in a certain country
increased signiﬁcantly. A governmental study, on the
other hand, shows a signiﬁcant decline in the length of
the average workweek for the same period. Examination
of the studies shows, however, that they used different
methods of investigation; thus there is no need to look
further for an explanation of the difference in the
studies’ results.
The argument’s reasoning is ﬂawed because the
argument fails to
(A)
(B)

distinguish between a study produced for the
purposes of the operation of government and a
study produced as part of university research
distinguish between a method of investigation
and the purpose of an investigation

10. Although the charter of Westside School states that the
student body must include some students with special
educational needs, no students with learning disabilities
have yet enrolled in the school. Therefore, the school is

(E)

All students with learning disabilities have special
educational needs.
The school currently has no students with
learning disabilities.
The school should enroll students with special

The only students with special educational needs
are students with learning disabilities.
The school’s charter cannot be modiﬁed in order

11. Some psychologists claim that, in theory, the best way
to understand another person would be through deep
empathy, whereby one would gain a direct and complete
grasp of that person’s motivations. But suppose they
are right; then there would be no way at all to achieve
understanding, since it is psychologically impossible
to gain a direct and complete grasp of another person’s
motivations. But obviously one can understand other
people; thus these psychologists are wrong.
The argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that it
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

fails to adequately deﬁne the key phrase “deep
empathy”
assumes something that it later denies, resulting
in a contradiction
confuses a theoretically best way of
accomplishing something with the only way of
accomplishing it
accepts a claim on mere authority, without
requiring sufﬁcient justiﬁcation
fails to consider that other psychologists may
disagree with the psychologists cited

12. The ﬁve senses have traditionally been viewed as
distinct yet complementary. Each sense is thought to
have its own range of stimuli that are incapable of
stimulating the other senses. However, recent research
has discovered that some people taste a banana and
claim that they are tasting blue, or see a color and say
that it has a speciﬁc smell. This shows that such people,
called synesthesiacs, have senses that do not respect the
usual boundaries between the ﬁve recognized senses.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
seriously weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Synesthesiacs demonstrate a general, systematic
impairment in their ability to use and
understand words.
Recent evidence strongly suggests that there are
other senses besides sight, touch, smell, hearing,
and taste.
The particular ways in which sensory
experiences overlap in synesthesiacs follow a
deﬁnite pattern.
The synesthetic phenomenon has been described
in the legends of various cultures.
Synesthesiacs can be temporarily rid of their
synesthetic experiences by the use of drugs.

13. Essayist: One of the claims of laissez-faire economics
is that increasing the minimum wage reduces the
total number of minimum-wage jobs available. In
a recent study, however, it was found that after an
increase in the minimum wage, fast-food
restaurants kept on roughly the same number of
minimum-wage employees as before the increase.
Therefore, laissez-faire economics is not entirely
accurate.
The essayist’s argument depends on assuming which
one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

If laissez-faire economics makes an incorrect
prediction about the minimum wage, then all
the doctrines of laissez-faire economics are
inaccurate.
Minimum-wage job availability at fast-food
restaurants included in the study was
representative of minimum-wage job
availability in general.
No study has ever found that a business has
decreased the number of its minimum-wage
employees after an increase in the minimum
wage.
The fast-food restaurants included in the study
did not increase the average wage paid to
employees.
The national unemployment rate did not increase
following the increase in the minimum wage.

14. Some people claim that every human discovery or
invention is an instance of self-expression. But what
they seem to ignore is that, trivially, anything we do
is self-expressive. So, until they can give us a more

obliged to take their claim seriously.
Which one of the following, if true, provides the most
support for the reasoning above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

All claims that are trivial are uninteresting.
Most people do not take trivial claims seriously.
No claims that are trivial are worthy of serious
consideration.
Every claim is open to both interesting and
uninteresting interpretations.
Every interpretation is either trivial or

Questions 15-16
Camera manufacturers typically advertise their
products by citing the resolution of their camera’s lenses,
the resolution of a lens being the degree of detail the lens is
capable of reproducing in the image it projects onto the ﬁlm.
Differences between cameras in this respect are irrelevant
for practical photography, however, since all modem lenses
are so excellent that they project far more detail onto the
ﬁlm than any photographic ﬁlm is capable of reproducing in
a developed image.
15. Which one of the following most accurately states the
main point of the argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Camera manufacturers ought to concentrate on
building other desirable qualities into their
cameras’ lenses, rather than concentrating only
on the lenses’ resolution.
Apart from differences in resolution, there is no
practical difference among modem cameras in
the quality of the images that they produce.
Advertised differences among cameras in the
resolution of their lenses have no practical
bearing on the cameras’ relative quality as
photographic tools.
In concentrating their advertising on the issue of
image quality, manufacturers are making a
mistake about the interests of potential
purchasers of cameras.
Differences among photographic ﬁlms in the
amount of detail they reproduce have a more
signiﬁcant effect on the quality of the developed
image than do differences in the resolution of
camera lenses.

16. The argument depends on assuming which one of the
following?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

The deﬁnition of the termn “resolution” does not
capture an important determinant of the quality
of photographic instruments and materials.
In determining the amount of detail reproduced in
the developed photographic image, differences
in the resolutions of available lenses do not
compound the deﬁciencies of available ﬁlm.
Variations in the method used to process the ﬁlm
do not have any signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁlm’s
resolution.
Flawless photographic technique is needed to
achieve the maximum image resolution possible
with the materials and equipment being used.
The only factors important in determining the
degree of detail reproduced in the ﬁnal
photographic print are the resolution of the
camera’s lens and the resolution of the ﬁlm.

17. Dietary researcher: A recent study reports that
laboratory animals that were fed reduced-calorie
diets lived longer than laboratory animals whose
caloric intake was not reduced. In response, some
doctors are advocating reduced-calorie diets, in
the belief that North Americans’ life spans can
thereby be extended. However, this conclusion is
not supported. Laboratory animals tend to eat
much more than animals in their natural habitats,
which leads to their having a shorter life
expectancy. Restricting their diets merely brings
their caloric intake back to natural, optimal levels
and reinstates their normal life spans.
Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken
the dietary researcher’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

North Americans, on average, consume a higher
number of calories than the optimal number of
calories for a human diet.
North Americans with high-fat, low-calorie diets
generally have a shorter life expectancy than
North Americans with low-fat, low-calorie diets.
Not all scientiﬁc results that have important
implications for human health are based on
studies of laboratory animals.
Some North Americans who follow reduced
calorie diets are long-lived.
There is a strong correlation between diet and
longevity in some species of animals.

18. Editorialist: The positions advanced by radical
environmentalists often contain hypotheses that
are false and proposals that are economically
infeasible. But there is a positive role to be played
even by these extremists, for the social and
political inertia that attends environmental issues
is so stubborn that even small areas of progress
can be made only if the populace fears
environmental disaster, however untenable the
reasons for those fears may be.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the editorialist’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The little progress that has been made in
improving the environment is mainly due to the
fear created by radical environmentalists.
Radical environmentalists, by promoting their
views, stimulate progress on environmental
issues.
Social and political inertia is most effectively
overcome by an extremely fearful populace,
regardless of whether its fears are well-founded.
Radical environmentalists often put forth
untenable positions in order to produce the fear
that is required to bring about moderate reforms.
Radical environmentalists advocate positions
without regard for factual support or economic
feasibility.

Questions 20-21
Professor Chan: The literature department’s undergraduate
courses should cover only true literary works, and not
such frivolous material as advertisements.
Professor Wigmore: Advertisements might or might not
be true literary works but they do have a powerfully
detrimental effect on society-largely because people
cannot discern their real messages. The literature
department’s courses give students the critical skills
to analyze and understand texts. Therefore, it is the
literature department’s responsibility to include the
study of advertisements in its undergraduate courses.
20. Which one of the following principles most strongly
supports Professor Wigmore’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

19. People should avoid taking the antacid calcium
carbonate in doses larger than half a gram, for despite
its capacity to neutralize stomach acids, calcium
carbonate can increase the calcium level in the blood
and thus impair kidney function. Moreover, just half
a gram of it can stimulate the production of gastrin, a
stomach hormone that triggers acid secretion.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Cessation of gastrin production is a more
effective method of controlling excess stomach
acid than is direct neutralization of stomach acid.
People who avoid taking more than half a gram
of calcium carbonate are less likely than average
to suffer from impaired kidney function.
Doses of calcium carbonate smaller than half a
gram can reduce stomach acid more effectively
than much larger doses do.
Half a gram of calcium carbonate can causally
contribute to both the secretion and the
neutralization of stomach acids.
Impaired kidney function may increase the level
of calcium in the blood.

Advertisements ought to be framed in such a way
that their real messages are immediately clear.
Any text that is subtly constructed and capable of
affecting people’s thought and action ought to
be considered a form of literature.
All undergraduate students ought to take at least
one course that focuses on the development of
critical skills.
The literature department’s courses ought to
enable students to analyze and understand any
text that could have a harmful effect on society.
Any professor teaching an undergraduate course
in the literature department ought to be free to
choose the material to be covered in that course.

21. Which one of the following is an assumption on which
Professor Wigmore’s argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Texts that are true literary works never have a
detrimental effect on society.
Courses offered by the literature department
cannot include both true literary works and
material such as advertisements.
Students who take courses in the literature
department do not get from those courses
other skills besides those needed to analyze and
understand texts.
Forms of advertising that convey their message
entirely through visual images do not have a
detrimental effect on society.
The literature department’s responsibility is not
limited to teaching students how to analyze true
literary works.

Sociologist: Some people argue that capital
punishment for theft was an essential part of the
labor discipline of British capitalism. Critics of
such a view argue that more people were executed
for theft in preindustrial England than were
executed in England after industrialization. But
such a criticism overlooks the fact that
industrialization and capitalism are two very
different social phenomena, and that the latter
predated the former by several centuries.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the passage by the point that
capitalism and industrialization are distinct?
(A)
(B)

It is cited as some evidence against the claim that
capital punishment for theft was an essential

capitalism.
It is cited as a fact supporting the critics of the

23. To be horriﬁc, a monster must be threatening. Whether
or not it presents psychological, moral, or social
dangers, or triggers enduring infantile fears, if a
monster is physically dangerous then it is threatening.
In fact, even a physically benign monster is horriﬁc if it
inspires revulsion.
Which one of the following logically follows from the
statements above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Any horror-story monster that is threatening is
also horriﬁc.
A monster that is psychologically dangerous, but
that does not inspire revulsion, is not horriﬁc.
If a monster triggers infantile fears but is not
physically dangerous, then it is not horriﬁc.
If a monster is both horriﬁc and psychologically
threatening, then it does not inspire revulsion.
All monsters that are not physically dangerous,
but that are psychologically dangerous and
inspire revulsion, are threatening.

24. Lawyer: The defendant wanted to clear the snow off
his car and in doing so knocked snow on the
sidewalk. This same snow melted and refroze,
forming ice on which the plaintiff fell, breaking
her hip. We argue that the defendant maliciously
harmed the plaintiff, because malice is intention
to cause harm and the defendant intentionally
removed the snow from his car and put it on the
sidewalk, which, unbeknownst to the defendant at
the time, would subsequently cause the injury
suffered by the plaintiff.
The ﬂawed reasoning in which one of the following is
most similar to that in the lawyer’s argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Alice asked her sister to lie in court.
Unbeknownst to Alice’s sister, lying in court is
against the law. So what Alice asked her sister
to do was illegal.
Bruce wanted to eat the mincemeat pie.
Unbeknownst to Bruce, the mincemeat pie was
poisonous. So Bruce wanted to eat poison.
Cheryl denigrated the wine. Cheryl’s sister had
picked out the wine. So though she may not

sister.
Deon had lunch with Ms. Osgood. Unbeknownst

stolen the car. So Edwina sold a stolen car.

25. Although wood-burning stoves are more efﬁcient than
open ﬁreplaces, they are also more dangerous. The
smoke that wood-burning stoves release up the chimney
is cooler than the smoke from an open ﬂame. Thus
it travels more slowly and deposits more creosote, a
ﬂammable substance that can clog a chimney-or worse,
ignite inside it.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The most efﬁcient wood-burning stoves produce
less creosote than do many open ﬁreplaces.
The amount of creosote produced depends not
only on the type of ﬂame but on how often the
stove or ﬁreplace is used.
Open ﬁreplaces pose more risk of severe
accidents inside the home than do wood-burning
stoves.
Open ﬁreplaces also produce a large amount of
creosote residue.
Homeowners in warm climates rarely use
ﬁreplaces or wood-burning stoves.

If a doctor gives a patient only a few options for lifestyle
modiﬁcation, the patient is more likely to adhere to the
doctor’s advice than if the doctor gives the patient many
options.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the principle illustrated above?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

2.

People are especially likely to ignore the advice
they get from doctors if they are confused about
that advice.
People dislike calculating the best of a variety of
choices unless they can see a clear difference
among the beneﬁts that would result from each
choice.
The tendency people have to alter their behavior
varies inversely with the number of alternatives
available to them for behavior modiﬁcation.
Most people are unlikely to follow their doctor’s
advice unless they can vividly imagine the
consequences of not following the advice.
In getting good results, the clarity with which a
doctor instructs a patient is of equal importance
to the accuracy of the doctor’s diagnosis on
which that instruction is based.

Sigatoka disease drastically reduces the yield of banana
trees and is epidemic throughout the areas of the world
where bananas are grown. The fungus that causes the
disease can be controlled with fungicides, but the
fungicides can pose a health hazard to people living
nearby. The fungicides are thus unsuitable for small
banana groves in populated areas. Fortunately, most
large banana plantations are in locations so isolated that
fungicides can be used safely there. Therefore, most of
the world’s banana crop is not seriously threatened by
Sigatoka disease.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It will eventually be possible to breed strains of
bananas that are resistant to Sigatoka disease.
Large plantations produce most or all of the
world’s bananas.
Sigatoka disease spreads more slowly on large
plantations than in small banana groves.
Sigatoka disease is the only disease that threatens
bananas on a worldwide scale.
Most of the banana trees that have not been
exposed to the Sigatoka fungus grow in small
banana groves.

To acquire a better understanding of the structure
and development of the human personality, some
psychologists study the personalities of animals.
Each of the following, if true, contributes to an
explanation of the practice mentioned above EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The actions of humans and animals are believed
to be motivated by similar instincts, but these
instincts are easier to discern in animals.
The law forbids certain experiments on humans
but permits them on animals.
It is generally less expensive to perform
experiments on animals than it is to perform
them on humans.
Proper understanding of human personality is
thought to provide a model for better
understanding the personality of animals.
Field observations of the behavior of young
animals often inspire insightful hypotheses
about human personality development.

A group of 1,000 students was randomly selected from
three high schools in a medium-sized city and asked
the question, “Do you plan to ﬁnish your high school
education?” More than 89 percent answered “Yes.” This
shows that the overwhelming majority of students want
to ﬁnish high school, and that if the national dropout
rate among high school students is high, it cannot be
due to a lack of desire on the part of the students.

Columnist: A democratic society cannot exist unless
its citizens have established strong bonds of mutual
trust. Such bonds are formed and strengthened
only by participation in civic organizations,
political parties, and other groups outside the
family. It is obvious then that widespread reliance
on movies and electronic media for entertainment
has an inherently corrosive effect on democracy.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the columnist’s argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Anyone who relies on movies and electronic
media for entertainment is unable to form a
strong bond of mutual trust with a citizen.
Civic organizations cannot usefully advance their
goals by using electronic media.
Newspapers and other forms of print media
strengthen, rather than weaken, democratic
institutions.
Relying on movies and electronic media for
entertainment generally makes people less likely
to participate in groups outside their families.
People who rely on movies and electronic media
for entertainment are generally closer to their
families than are those who do not.

There exist several different techniques for
collecting samples of prehistoric pigments on
limestone.
Laboratory procedures exist that can remove all
the limestone from a sample of prehistoric paint
on limestone.
The age of the limestone itself can be determined
from samples that contain no vegetable-based
paint.
Prehistoric artists did not use anything other than
vegetable matter to make their paints.
The proportion of carbon to other elements in
limestone is the same in all samples of
limestone.

Questions 7-8
Dr. Jones: The new technology dubbed “telemedicine” will
provide sustained improvement in at least rural patient
care since it allows rural physicians to televise medical
examinations to specialists who live at great
distances—specialists who will thus be able to provide
advice the rural patient would otherwise not receive.
Dr. Carabella: Not so. Telemedicine might help rural
patient care initially. However, small hospitals will
soon realize that they can minimize expenses by
replacing physicians with technicians who can use
telemedicine to transmit examinations to large medical
centers, resulting in fewer patients being able to receive
traditional, direct medical examinations. Eventually, it
will be the rare individual who ever gets truly personal
attention. Hence, rural as well as urban patient care
will suffer.
7.

Which one of the following is a point at issue between
Dr. Jones and Dr. Carabella?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

8.

whether medical specialists in general offer
better advice than rural physicians
whether telemedicine technology will be installed
only in rural hospitals and rural medical centers
whether telemedicine is likely to be widely
adopted in rural areas in future years
whether the patients who most need the advice of
medical specialists are likely to receive it
through telemedicine
whether the technology of telemedicine will
beneﬁt rural patients in the long run

Dr. Carabella uses which one of the following strategies
in responding to Dr. Jones?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

listing a set of considerations to show that a
prescribed treatment that seems to be beneﬁting
a patient in fact harms that patient
describing the application of the technology
discussed by Dr. Jones as one step that initiates
a process that leads to an undesirable end
citing evidence that Dr. Jones lacks the
professional training to judge the case at issue
invoking medical statistics that cast doubt on the
premises used in Dr. Jones’s argument
providing grounds for dismissing Dr. Jones’s
interpretation of a key term in medical
technology

Lines can be parallel in a Euclidean system of
geometry. But the non-Euclidean system of geometry
that has the most empirical veriﬁcation is regarded by
several prominent physicists as correctly describing the
universe we inhabit. If these physicists are right, in our
universe there are no parallel lines.
Which one of the following is an assumption that is
required by the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

There are no parallel lines in the non-Euclidean
system of geometry that has the most empirical
veriﬁcation.
Most physicists have not doubted the view that
the universe is correctly described by the nonEuclidean system of geometry that has the most
empirical veriﬁcation.
There are no parallel lines in every nonEuclidean system of geometry that has any
empirical veriﬁcation.
The universe is correctly described by the nonEuclidean system of geometry that has the most
empirical veriﬁcation if prominent physicists
maintain that it is.
Only physicists who are not prominent doubt the
view that the universe is correctly described by
the non-Euclidean system of geometry that has
the most empirical veriﬁcation.

10. Philosopher: People are not intellectually well suited
to live in large, bureaucratic societies. Therefore,
people can ﬁnd happiness, if at all, only in smaller
political units such as villages.
The reasoning in the philosopher’s argument is ﬂawed
because the argument takes for granted that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

no one can ever be happy living in a society in
which she or he is not intellectually well suited
to live
the primary purpose of small political units such
as villages is to make people happy
all societies that are plagued by excessive
bureaucracy are large
anyone who lives in a village or other small
political unit that is not excessively bureaucratic
can ﬁnd happiness
everyone is willing to live in villages or other
small political units

11. The present goal of the ﬁeld of medicine seems to
be to extend life indeﬁnitely. Increasingly, the ability
to transplant such organs as hearts, lungs, livers, and
kidneys will allow us to live longer. But we can never
achieve brain transplants. There are, for a start, ten
million nerves running from the brain down the neck,
not to mention the millions joining the brain to the
sensing organs. Clearly, then, as the transplantation
of organs allows more and more people to live longer,
those with degenerative brain disorders will form an
ever-increasing proportion of the population.
The argument above is based on which one of the
following assumptions?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Degenerative brain disorders will increasingly
strike younger and younger patients.
It is still quite rare for people to live long enough
to need more than one transplant of any given
organ.
There are degenerative brain disorders that will
not be curable without brain transplants.
Degenerative brain disorders account for a very
small proportion of deaths in the population at
large.
More is being spent on research into degenerative
brain disorders than on research into
transplantation.

12. Politician: My opponents argue that the future of
our city depends on compromise-that unless
the city’s leaders put aside their differences and
work together toward common goals, the city
will suffer. However, the founders of this city
based the city’s charter on deﬁnite principles, and
anyone who compromises those principles betrays
the city founders’ goals. What my opponents
are advocating, therefore, is nothing less than
betraying the goals of the city’s founders.
Critic: I’m afraid your argument is ﬂawed. Unless
you’re assuming that the differences among the
city’s leaders are differences of principle, your
argument depends on a misleading use of the term
Which one of the following provides the most logical

13. Though many insects die soon after reproducing for the
ﬁrst time, some may live for years after the survival of
the next generation has been secured. Among the latter
are some insects that work for the beneﬁt of the
ecosystem-for example, bees.
Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Survival of the species, rather than of the
individual, is the goal of most insect
populations.
Insects that do not play a vital role in the
ecosystem are more likely to die after
reproducing for the ﬁrst time.
Most bees live well beyond the onset of the
generation that follows them.
Those bees that reproduce do not always die
soon after reproducing for the ﬁrst time.
Most insects are hatched self-sufﬁcient and do
not need to be cared for by adult insects.

14. People’s political behavior frequently does not
match their rhetoric. Although many complain about
government intervention in their lives, they tend
not to reelect inactive politicians. But a politician’s
activity consists largely in the passage of laws whose
enforcement affects voters’ lives. Thus, voters often
reelect politicians whose behavior they resent.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the role played in the argument by the claim that people
tend not to reelect inactive politicians?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It describes a phenomenon for which the
argument’s conclusion is offered as an
explanation.
It is a premise offered in support of the
conclusion that voters often reelect politicians
whose behavior they resent.
It is offered as an example of how a politician’s
activity consists largely in the passage of laws
whose enforcement interferes with voters’ lives.
It is a generalization based on the claim that
people complain about government intervention
in their lives.
It is cited as evidence that people’s behavior
never matches their political beliefs.

15. Lea:

Contemporary art has become big business.
Nowadays art has less to do with self-expression
than with making money. The work of
contemporary artists is utterly bereft of
spontaneity and creativity, as a visit to any art
gallery demonstrates.

Susan: I disagree. One can still ﬁnd spontaneous,
innovative new artwork in most of the smaller,
independent galleries.
Lea’s and Susan’s remarks provide the most support for
holding that they disagree about whether
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

large galleries contain creative artwork
most galleries contain some artwork that lacks
spontaneity and creativity
contemporary art has become big business
some smaller art galleries still exhibit creative
new artwork
contemporary art, in general, is much less
concerned with self-expression than older art is

16. Ethicist: In a recent judicial decision, a contractor was
ordered to make restitution to a company because
of a bungled construction job, even though the
company had signed a written agreement prior to
entering into the contract that the contractor
would not be ﬁnancially liable should the task not
be adequately performed. Thus, it was morally
wrong for the company to change its mind and
seek restitution.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the ethicist’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

It is morally wrong for one party not to abide by
its part of an agreement only if the other party
abides by its part of the agreement.
It is morally wrong to seek a penalty for an
action for which the agent is unable to make
restitution.
It is morally wrong for one person to seek to
penalize another person for an action that the
ﬁrst person induced the other person to perform.
It is morally wrong to ignore the terms of an
agreement that was freely undertaken only if
there is clear evidence that the agreement was
legally permissible.
It is morally wrong to seek compensation for an
action performed in the context of a promise to
forgo such compensation.

17. Zoologist: Animals can certainly signal each other
with sounds and gestures. However, this does not
conﬁrm the thesis that animals possess language,
for it does not prove that animals possess the
ability to use sounds or gestures to refer to
concrete objects or abstract ideas.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the zoologist’s argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Animals do not have the cognitive capabilities to
entertain abstract ideas.
If an animal’s system of sounds or gestures is not
a language, then that animal is unable to
entertain abstract ideas.
When signaling each other with sounds or
gestures, animals refer neither to concrete
objects nor abstract ideas.
If a system of sounds or gestures contains no
expressions referring to concrete objects or
abstract ideas, then that system is not a language.
Some animals that possess a language can refer
to both concrete objects and abstract ideas.

18. A person is more likely to become disabled as that
person ages. Among adults in the country of East
Wendell, however, the proportion receiving disability
beneﬁt payments shrinks from 4 percent among 55 to
64 year olds to 2 percent for those aged 65 to 74 and
1 percent for those aged 75 and older. The explanation
of this discrepancy is that the proportion of jobs
offering such a disability beneﬁt has greatly increased
in recent years.
Which one of the following, if true about East Wendell,
shows that the explanation above is at best incomplete?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

The treatment of newly incurred disabilities is
more successful now than in the past in
restoring partial function in the affected area
within six months.
Some people receive disability beneﬁt payments
under employers’ insurance plans, and some
receive them from the government.
Medical advances have prolonged the average
lifespan beyond what it was 20 years ago.
For persons receiving disability beneﬁt payments,
those payments on average represent a smaller
share of their predisability income now than
was the case 20 years ago.
Under most employers’ plans, disability beneﬁt
payments stop when an employee with a
disability reaches the usual retirement age of 65.

19. Light is registered in the retina when photons hit
molecules of the pigment rhodopsin and change the
molecules’ shape. Even when they have not been struck
by photons of light, rhodopsin molecules sometimes
change shape because of normal molecular motion,
thereby introducing error into the visual system. The
amount of this molecular motion is directly proportional
to the temperature of the retina.
Which one of the following conclusions is most
strongly supported by the information above?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

The temperature of an animal’s retina depends on
the amount of light the retina is absorbing.
The visual systems of animals whose body
temperature matches that of their surroundings
are more error-prone in hot surroundings than in
cold ones.
As the temperature of the retina rises, rhodopsin
molecules react more slowly to being struck by
photons.
Rhodopsin molecules are more sensitive to
photons in animals whose retinas have large
surface areas than in animals whose retinas have
small surface areas.
Molecules of rhodopsin are the only pigment
molecules that occur naturally in the retina.

20. Critic: Political utility determines the popularity of
a metaphor. In authoritarian societies, the metaphor
of society as a human body governed by a head is
pervasive. Therefore, the society-as-body
metaphor, with its connection between society’s
proper functioning and governance by a head,
promotes greater acceptance of authoritarian
repression than do other metaphors, such as
likening society to a family.
Which one of the following statements, if true, most
weakens the critic’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

In authoritarian societies, the metaphor of society
as a family is just as pervasive as the society-asbody metaphor.
Every society tries to justify the legitimacy of its
government through the use of metaphor.
The metaphor of society as a human body is
sometimes used in nonauthoritarian societies.
Authoritarian leaders are always searching for
new metaphors for society in their effort to
maintain their power.
The metaphor of society as a human body
governed by a head is rarely used in liberal
democracies.

21. Thirty years ago, the percentage of their income that
single persons spent on food was twice what it is today.
Given that incomes have risen over the past thirty years,
we can conclude that incomes have risen at a greater
rate than the price of food in that period.
Which one of the following, if assumed, helps most to
justify the conclusion drawn above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The amount of food eaten per capita today is
identical to the amount of food eaten per capita
thirty years ago.
In general, single persons today eat healthier
foods and eat less than their counterparts of
thirty years ago.
Single persons today, on average, purchase the
same kinds of food items in the same quantities
as they did thirty years ago.
The prices of nonfood items single persons
purchase have risen faster than the price of food
over the past thirty years.
Unlike single persons, families today spend
about the same percentage of their income on
food as they did thirty years ago.

22. Viruses can have beneﬁcial effects. For example, some
kill more-complex microorganisms, some of which
are deadly to humans. But viruses have such simple
structures that replacing just a few of a beneﬁcial
virus’s several million atoms can make it deadly to
humans. Clearly, since alterations of greater complexity
than this are commonly produced by random mutations,
any virus could easily become dangerous to humans.
If the statements above are true, then each of the
following statements could also be true EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Random mutation makes some deadly viruses
beneﬁcial to humans.
Some organisms of greater complexity than
viruses are no more likely than viruses to
undergo signiﬁcant alterations through random
mutation.
Some microorganisms that are more complex
than viruses are beneﬁcial to humans.
Some viruses that fail to kill other viruses that
are deadly to humans are nevertheless beneﬁcial
to humans.
No virus that is deadly to organisms of greater
complexity than itself is beneﬁcial to humans.

23. Societies in which value is measured primarily in
ﬁnancial terms invariably fragment into isolated social
units. But since money is not the main measure of value
in nonindustrial societies, they must tend in contrast to
be socially uniﬁed.
The ﬂawed reasoning in which one of the following is
most similar to that in the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Animals of different genera cannot interbreed.
But that does not prove that jackals and wolves
cannot interbreed, for they belong to the same
genus.
Ecosystems close to the equator usually have
more species than those closer to the poles.
Thus, the Sahara Desert must contain more
species than Siberia does, since the latter is
farther from the equator.
Insects pass through several stages of maturation:
egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Since insects are
arthropods, all arthropods probably undergo
similar maturation processes.
Poets frequently convey their thoughts via
nonliteral uses of language such as metaphors
and analogies. But journalists are not poets, so
surely journalists always use language literally.
Technologically sophisticated machines often
cause us more trouble than simpler devices
serving the same function. Since computers are
more technologically sophisticated than pencils,
they must tend to be more troublesome.

24. Ringtail opossums are an Australian wildlife species
that is potentially endangered. A number of ringtail
opossums that had been orphaned and subsequently
raised in captivity were monitored after being returned
to the wild. Seventy-ﬁve percent of these opossums
were killed by foxes, a species not native to Australia.
Conservationists concluded that the native ringtail
opossum population was endangered not by a scarcity
of food, as had been previously thought, but by nonnative predator species against which the opossum had
not developed natural defenses.
Which one of the following, if true, most strongly
supports the conservationists’ argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

There are fewer non-native predator species that
prey on the ringtail opossum than there are
native species that prey on the ringtail opossum.
Foxes, which were introduced into Australia over
200 years ago, adapted to the Australian climate
less successfully than did some other foreign
species.
The ringtail opossums that were raised in
captivity were fed a diet similar to that which
ringtail opossums typically eat in the wild.
Few of the species that compete with the ringtail
opossum for food sources are native to Australia.
Ringtail opossums that grow to adulthood in the
wild defend themselves against foxes no more
successfully than do ringtail opossums raised in
captivity.

25. Jordan: If a business invests the money necessary
to implement ecologically sound practices, its
market share will decrease. But if it doesn’t
implement these practices, it pollutes the
environment and wastes resources.
Terry: But if consumers demand environmental
responsibility of all businesses, no particular
business will be especially hurt.
In which one of the following exchanges is the logical
relationship between Jordan’s and Terry’s statements
most similar to the logical relationship between their
statements above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Jordan: Either it will rain and our plans for a
picnic will be thwarted or it won’t rain and the
garden will go yet another day without muchneeded watering.
Terry: But if it doesn’t rain, we can buy a hose
and water the garden with the hose.
Jordan: Each person can have either an
enjoyable life or a long life, for one must eat
vegetables and exercise continuously to stay
healthy.
Terry: That’s not true: there are many happy
health-conscious people.
Jordan: If taxes are raised, many social
problems could be solved, but if they’re
lowered, the economy will grow again. So we
can’t have both social reform and a growing
economy.
Terry: But if taxes remain at their current level,
neither social problems nor the economy will
get worse.
Jordan: If we remodel the kitchen, the house
will be more valuable, but even if we do, there’s
no guarantee that we’ll actually get more for the
house when we sell it.
Terry: But if we don’t remodel the kitchen, we
might get even less for the house than we paid
for it.
Jordan: If the dam’s spillway is opened, the
river might ﬂood the eastern part of town, but if
the spillway is not opened, the dam might burst.
Terry: There’s no real danger of the dam’s
bursting, but if we get more heavy rain, opening
the spillway is the most prudent policy.

26. The media now devote more coverage to crime than
they did ten years ago. Yet this is not because the crime
rate has increased, but rather because the public is now
more interested in reading and hearing about crime.
After all, a crucial factor in the media’s decisions about
what issues to cover and to what extent to cover them is
the interests of their audiences.
The proposition that the public is now more interested
in reading and hearing about crime plays which one of
the following roles in the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It supports the conclusion that the media now
devote more coverage to crime than the crime
rate alone justiﬁes.
It is presented as evidence that the media decide
what to cover and to what extent to cover it
depending on the interests of the public.
It is a counterexample to the claim that the media
devote more coverage to crime now than they
did ten years ago.
It is a generalization based on the claim that the
crime rate has increased over the past ten years.
It is offered as an alternative explanation of why
the media devote more coverage to crime now
than they did ten years ago.
