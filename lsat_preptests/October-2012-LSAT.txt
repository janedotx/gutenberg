Until my present study, African American
entertainer Lorenzo Tucker had not been extensively
discussed in histories of United States theater and film.
Yet during a span of 60 years, from 1926 to 1986,
he acted in 20 films and performed hundreds of times
on stage as a dancer, vaudeville straight man, singer,
actor, and master of ceremonies. Behind the scenes he
worked as a producer, company manager, publicity
person, lighting designer, photographer, and actors’
union administrator. In addition, Tucker was a firsthand
witness to the history of African American theater
and film from the late 1920s until his death in 1986.
During his later years, he amassed a large collection
of African American theater and film memorabilia,
and these artifacts, along with his personal memories,
help shed new light on a part of U.S. entertainment
history about which, so far, there has been
insufficient scholarship.
I gathered much of the background material
for my study of Tucker’s life through research in
special collections of the New York and Los Angeles
public libraries, including microfilmed correspondence,
photographs, programs, and newspapers. Also
examined—as primary source material for an analysis
of Tucker’s acting technique—were the ten still
available films in which Tucker appeared. Additional
information was acquired through interviews with
some of Tucker’s contemporaries and fellow
performers. The primary source of information for
this study, however, was a group of personal, in-depth
interviews I conducted with Tucker himself in 1985
and 1986.
There are both advantages and disadvantages in
undertaking a biographical study of a living person.
The greatest advantage is that the contemporary
biographer has access to that person’s oral testimony.
Yet this testimony must be approached with caution,
since each person recounting his or her version of
events for the historical record has a vested interest in
the project, and no matter how fair-minded and
objective one intends to be, the fact is that people
often remember the events they want to remember in
the version they prefer. It is the duty of the
biographer, therefore, to verify as much of the oral
narrative as possible.
Information from Tucker has undergone careful
scrutiny and has been placed up against the known
facts for verification, and for the most part, information
that could not be verified was not included in this
study. But Tucker’s recollections of his personal life
could not always be independently verified, of course,

(55)

(60)

since most of the daily events in the life of any
individual go unrecorded. So only those elements of
Tucker’s personal life that had a bearing on his career
have been recorded here. At the same time, however,
it is important to note that the majority of these
recollections tend to corroborate, while illuminating
and providing a valuable perspective on, other relevant
historical evidence that is available. This study,
therefore, will weave together oral and other evidence
to create the career biography of Lorenzo Tucker.

1. Which one of the following most accurately summarizes
the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The career biography of Tucker constitutes
an important addition to the history of
U.S. theater and film mainly because of the
innovative methods used in researching this
subject, which correct previous misinterpretations
of an aspect of U.S. film and theater history.
Evidence from a variety of sources, including
information from Tucker’s own oral accounts,
has been scrutinized and combined to create
a career biography of Tucker that fills certain
gaps in the historical record of U.S. theater
and film.
Tucker’s interest in preserving a record of the
development of African American film and
theater and his initiative in making that record
public have led to the filling of a gap in the
published histories of performing arts.
The research methods used in creating the
biography of Tucker exemplify some of the
problems inherent in the quest for objectivity
in recording the history of recent or
contemporary events and persons.
Previous theater and film historians have been
mistaken in paying too little attention to the
extensive nonperforming contributions that
Tucker made to the development of African
American film and theater.

being at considerable risk of misrepresenting
some historical facts
a source of information that merely duplicates
what is available in the public record

Its subject matter and methodology make it
appropriate for publication by a publisher of
popular books but not for publication by an
academic press.
It should be valuable to scholars not only
because of the research-based information it
contains, but also because of the innovative
research methods developed and implemented
by the author.
It should be interesting not only because of
its account of Tucker’s career, but also because
of the significant information it provides
regarding U.S. entertainment history.
It should not be taken mainly as an attempt to
report an objectively accurate historical record
of events in Tucker’s career.
It should be accepted as a useful and reliable
methodological guide for use in verifying the
authenticity of U.S. entertainment memorabilia.

based on a close examination of a preponderance
of the films in which Tucker performed.
Its rhetorical structure is not closely analogous
to the structures of a majority of previous
scholarly biographies of African American
performers.

Taking the explication of experience as its
object as well as its method, Marjorie Shostak’s
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman weaves
together three narrative strands, and in doing so
challenges the ethnographer’s penchant for the general
and the anonymous. The first strand, the autobiographical
details of a 50-year-old woman’s life among the
seminomadic !Kung hunter-gatherers of Botswana,
adds to the ethnographical literature on the !Kung.
The second presents Nisa’s story as a metaphor for
woman’s experience, a story that reflects many of the
experiences and dilemmas addressed in recent feminist
writing. The third tells the story of an intercultural
encounter in which the distinction between ethnographer
and subject becomes blurred.
Nisa explains Nisa’s personality in terms of
!Kung ways and, for the general reader, corrects and
qualifies a number of received attitudes about “simple”
societies. Michel Leiris’ warning that “We are all too
inclined to consider a people happy if considering
them makes us happy” applies particularly to the
!Kung, whose seemingly uncomplicated way of life,
enlightened attitudes toward child rearing, and
undeniable charm make them prime candidates for
Western appreciation. But Nisa’s answer to Shostak’s
question, “What is it to be a !Kung woman?” makes
us feel the force of ugly facts we might otherwise
skim over. Only 54 percent of !Kung children live to
marry; Nisa loses all four of her children and a
cherished husband. Nisa’s memories of sibling
rivalries, of her terrible rages when denied her mother,
of nasty fights over food undermine the idyllic
vision Westerners cherish of childhoods lived in such
“simple” circumstances.
Woven into Nisa’s autobiography are allusions to
Shostak’s personal engagement with issues of gender.
Nisa’s response to “What is it to be a !Kung woman?”
also seems to answer another question, “What is it to
be a woman?” In fact, Nisa’s answers illuminate not
just one woman’s experience, but women’s experience
in general. It is a salutary shock to realize how much
ethnographic literature omits the perspective of
women about women.
Nisa’s story is interwoven with Shostak’s
presentation of their encounter; at times each seems to
exist primarily in response to the other. Nisa’s
autobiography is a distinct narrative in a particular
voice, but it is manifestly the product of a collaboration.
Indeed, by casting Nisa in the shape of a “life,”
Shostak employs a potent Western literary convention.
Real lives, in fact, do not easily arrange themselves
as stories that have recognizable shapes: Nisa, for
example, often says “We lived in that place, eating
things. Then we left and went somewhere else.” It is
in the process of the dialogue between Nisa and
Shostak that a shaped story emerges from this
seemingly featureless background.

8. Shostak’s approach to ethnography differs from the
approach of most ethnographers in which one of the
following ways?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

She observes the culture of one group in order
to infer the cultural characteristics of other,
similar groups.
She studies the life experiences of individuals
apart from the cultural practices of a group.
She contrasts individuals’ personal histories
with information about the individuals’ culture.
She exemplifies her general hypotheses about
a culture by accumulating illustrative
empirical data.
She emphasizes the importance of the personal
and the individual.

9. Which one of the following best expresses the author’s
opinion of the way most ethnographic literature deals
with women’s views of women?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is admirable that many ethnographic studies
avoid the narrow focus of some recent
feminist thought as it deals with women’s
views of women.
It is encouraging that most women
ethnographers have begun to study and report
the views of women in the groups they study.
It is unfortunate that most ethnographic
literature does not deal with women’s views
of women at all.
It is surprising that more ethnographic studies
of women do not use the information available
through individual interviews of women
about women.
It is disappointing that most ethnographic
studies of women’s views about women fail
to connect individual experiences with larger
women’s issues.

10. It can be inferred that which one of the following best
exemplifies the “received attitudes” mentioned in line 18?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The !Kung are people of undeniable charm.
Considering the !Kung makes Western
observers happy.
People who live seminomadic lives have few
serious problems.
A large percentage of !Kung children die
before reaching adulthood.
The experience of seminomadic women is
much like that of other women.

11. Which one of the following would most clearly support
the author’s contention that Nisa’s experience as a !Kung
woman illuminates women’s experience in general?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A systematic survey of a representative sample
of Western women indicates that these women
sympathize with Nisa’s tragedies.
The use of the explication of experience as
both a subject and a method becomes an
extremely fruitful technique for ethnographers
studying issues facing both men and women
in non-Western cultures.
Critics of feminist writers applaud the use of
Shostak’s dialogue technique in the study of
women’s issues.
Another ethnographer explores the experiences
of individual women in a culture quite
different from that of the !Kung and finds
many issues that are common to both cultures.
Ethnographers studying the !Kung interview
!Kung women other than Nisa and find that
most of them report experiences similar to
those of Nisa.

12. It can be inferred that the “potent Western literary
convention” mentioned in line 50 is most probably
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

personal revelation
dramatic emphasis
expository comparison
poetic metaphor
novelistic storytelling

similar to Shostak’s approach as her approach is
described in the passage?

of an individual in order to exemplify the way
of life of a group of desert dwellers.
A writer illustrates her views of women’s
experience by recounting stories from her
own childhood.
The developer of a series of textbooks uses
anecdotes based on the experiences of people
of many cultures to highlight important points
in the text.

14. It can be inferred that the author of the passage believes
that the quotation in lines 53–54 best exemplifies which
one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the cultural values of seminomadic peoples
such as the !Kung
the amorphous nature of the accounts people
give of their lives
the less-than-idyllic nature of the lives of
nomadic people

Passage A
Until recently, conservationists were often
complacent about the effect of nonindigenous plant
and animal species on the ecosystems they invade.
Many shared Charles Elton’s view, introduced in his
1958 book on invasive species, that disturbed habitats
are most vulnerable to new arrivals because they
contain fewer or less vigorous native species.
Now, however, ecologists realize that when humans
introduce new species into existing ecosystems, even
pristine, species-rich habitats are threatened.
The rapidly increasing conservation problems and
high damage and control costs generated by these
invasions merit serious concern.
Invasive plants profoundly affect ecosystems
and threaten biodiversity throughout the world.
For example, to the untrained eye, the Everglades
National Park in Florida appears wild and natural.
Yet this and other unique ecosystems are being
degraded as surely as if by chemical pollution. In
Florida, forests are growing where none existed
before. Traditionally, saw grass dominated large
regions of Florida’s marshes, providing habitat for
unique Everglades wildlife. Although saw grass grows
over 9 feet tall, introduced Australian melaleuca trees,
typically 70 feet tall, now outcompete marsh plants
for sunlight. As melaleuca trees grow and form dense
stands, their leaf litter increases soil elevations,
inhibiting normal water flow. Wildlife associated with
saw grass marshes declines. Similarly, in Australia,
the introduction of Scotch broom plants led to the
disappearance of a diverse set of native reptiles.
Passage B
The real threat posed by so-called invasive
species isn’t against nature but against humans’ ideas
of what nature is supposed to be. Species invasion is
not a zero-sum game, with new species replacing old
ones at a one-to-one ratio. Rather, and with critical
exceptions, it is a positive-sum game, in which
ecosystems can accept more and more species. Indeed,
in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, ecologists
have found that invasions often increase biodiversity
at the local level: if you add many new species and
lose few or no native species, the overall species
count goes up.
Invasions don’t cause ecosystems to collapse.
Invasions may radically alter the components of an
ecosystem, perhaps to a point at which the ecosystem
becomes less valuable or engaging to humans.
But 50 years of study has failed to identify a clear
ecological difference between an ecosystem rich in
native species and one chock-full of introduced
species. Unlike ecosystem destruction—clear cutting
of forests, for example—invasions don’t make
ecosystems shrink or disappear. They simply
transform them into different ecosystems.
When the issue is phrased as one of ecosystem
destruction, the stakes are stark: we choose between
nature’s life and nature’s death. In actuality, introduced
species present a continuum. A few species do cause
costly damage and tragic extinctions. But most plant

(60)

and animal species simply blend in harmlessly. The
issue they present for humans is not whether we will
be surrounded by nature but rather what kind of nature
we will have around us.

15. Both passages are concerned with answering which one
of the following questions?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Why are some ecosystems more vulnerable
to introduced species than others?
What distinguishes introduced species that are
harmful from those that are harmless?
What approach should be taken to protect
ecosystems from introduced species?
How are ecosystems affected by the
introduction of new species?
How are species able to spread beyond their
native ecosystems?

16. Passage A, but not passage B, asserts which one of
the following regarding ecologists who study
introduced species?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Their research has been limited to studying
the economic impact of introduced species.
They are inconsistent in their use of criteria
for determining what defines an ecosystem.
Most agree that introduced species can
cause extinctions.
Before Elton, most of them were concerned
only with preserving biodiversity at the
local level.
They do not share Elton’s view that introduced
species primarily threaten disturbed habitats.

17. The author of passage B would be most likely to agree
with which one of the following statements about the
term “natural” as it is used in passage A (line 17)?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It correctly characterizes a difference between
pristine and disturbed environments.
It contradicts a concept of nature put forth
elsewhere in passage A.
It helps to clarify a difference between the
“wild” and the “natural.”
It introduces an unconventional definition
of nature.
It conflates physical nature with an arbitrary
ideal of nature.

it starts to fray after many years is not
necessarily a meaningful loss.
The alteration of a culture’s folk music by the
influence of music from other cultures is not
always lamentable.
The expansion of urban development into
previously rural areas is a necessary
consequence of progress.
Cultures can only benefit when they absorb
and adapt ideas that originated in other cultures.
While horticulturalists can create new plant
species through hybridization, hybridization
also occurs in the wild.

well-founded.
Passage A presents evidence that a particular
phenomenon is widely considered to be
undesirable, while passage B presents
evidence that the same phenomenon is
usually considered to be beneficial.
Passage A warns about the dangers of a
particular phenomenon, while passage B
argues that the phenomenon should not
generally be considered dangerous.

Can a sovereign have unlimited legal power?
If a sovereign does have unlimited legal power, then
the sovereign presumably has the legal power to limit
or even completely abdicate its own legal power.
But doing so would mean that the sovereign no longer
has unlimited legal power, thereby contradicting the
initial supposition. This theoretical conundrum is
traditionally known as the paradox of omnipotence.
Social scientists have recognized that sovereign
omnipotence can be a source of considerable practical
difficulty for sovereigns themselves. Douglass North
and Barry Weingast show that English and French
monarchies in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries confronted a practical challenge created by
the paradox of their own omnipotence.
North and Weingast point out that it is often in
a sovereign’s best interest to make a credible
commitment not to perform certain acts. For example,
a sovereign with absolute power can refuse to honor
its financial commitments. Yet creditors will not
voluntarily lend generous amounts at favorable
terms to an absolute monarch who can renege upon
debts at will.
In the struggle to expand their empires, the
English and French monarchies required vast amounts
of capital. At the outset of the seventeenth century,
however, neither regime could credibly commit itself
to repay debts or to honor property rights. The absence
of limitations upon the legal power of monarchs meant
that there was no law or commitment monarchs could
make that they could not also unmake or disregard.
Consequently, these monarchs earned a reputation for
expropriating wealth, repudiating debts, and reneging
upon commitments. Not surprisingly, creditors took
such behavior into account and demanded higher
interest rates from monarchs than from the monarchs’
wealthy subjects.
North and Weingast argue that the constitutional
settlement imposed in England by the Glorious
Revolution of 1688 halted such faithless conduct.
Henceforth, Parliament controlled the Crown’s purse
strings. Parliament, in turn, represented commercial
interests that would not tolerate governmental
disregard for property rights. The Crown’s newfound
inability to dishonor its commitments translated into a
newfound ability to borrow: the Crown’s borrowing
increased and interest rates fell, because lenders
concluded that the Crown would honor its debts.
Thanks to North, Weingast, and others writing
in the same vein, it is now conventional to hold that
constitutional arrangements benefit sovereigns by
limiting their power. But such scholars neglect the
extent to which constitutions can fail in this regard.
For example, the constitutional settlement imposed
by the Glorious Revolution did not solve the paradox
of omnipotence but just relocated the problem from
one branch of government to another: whereas it was
once the Crown that lacked the power to bind itself,
it is now Parliament that lacks this power. The

(60)

doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty is a pillar of
England’s unwritten constitution, and it provides that
Parliament lacks legal power over the extent of its
own legal power.

20. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The paradox of omnipotence poses a practical
problem for governments, which is not
necessarily solved by constitutional arrangements.
Abstract theoretical paradoxes often have
practical analogues in the political sphere.
The paradox of omnipotence ceased to be an
acute practical problem for English monarchs
after the Glorious Revolution.
Contrary to what many social scientists
believe, the Glorious Revolution did not solve
the practical problem of sovereign omnipotence
faced by English monarchs.
The supposition that a sovereign has unlimited
legal power leads to a logical contradiction.

21. The passage most strongly supports the claim that
creditors in England and France in the years before
1688 held which one of the following views about
wealthy subjects in those countries?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

They did not contribute their fair share to the
cost of expanding the empires.
They focused on short-term gains at the
expense of their own credibility.
They were trying to establish a government
that would respect property rights.
They clearly understood the paradox of
sovereign omnipotence.
They were more likely than their monarchs to
honor financial commitments.

22. Based on the passage, which one of the following
considerations would be most important for an English
creditor after the Glorious Revolution who is deciding
whether to lend money to the Crown at a relatively
low interest rate?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

whether most members of Parliament are aware
of the paradox of sovereign omnipotence
whether Parliament can be depended on to
adequately represent commercial interests
when the most recent Parliamentary elections
were held
how many new laws Parliament has enacted
in the past year
whether the Crown’s borrowing has increased
in recent years

23. Which one of the following principles underlies the
author’s argument in the last paragraph of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The adequacy of a solution to a political
problem should be judged in terms of
practical consequences rather than theoretical
considerations.
A genuine solution to a political problem must
eliminate the problem’s fundamental cause
rather than just its effects.
A problem inherent in a certain form of
government can be solved only if that form
of government is completely abandoned.
In terms of practical consequences, it is
preferable for unlimited legal power to rest
with an elected body rather than an
unelected monarch.
A country’s constitution should explicitly
specify the powers of each branch of
government.

24. According to the passage, which one of the following
was a consequence of the absence of limitations on the
legal power of English and French monarchs in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

It was difficult for those monarchs to finance
the expansion of their empires.
Those monarchs enacted new laws to specify
the obligations of creditors.
It became increasingly easy for wealthy subjects
in England and France to borrow money.
Those monarchs borrowed more money than
they would have if their power had been
restricted.
Those monarchs were forced to demonstrate
a willingness to respect property rights.

25. The author mentions the English and French monarchies’
need for capital (lines 24–26) primarily in order to
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

cast doubt on the claim that it is in a
sovereign’s interest to make a commitment
not to perform certain acts
illustrate the low opinion that creditors had
of monarchs
emphasize the unlimited nature of the legal
power of monarchs
help explain why the paradox of omnipotence
was an acute practical problem for those
monarchies
reinforce the claim that sovereigns have
historically broken their commitments for
short-term gain

26. Suppose the Parliament in England makes a
commitment to become a permanent member of a
multinational body. It can be inferred from the
passage that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the commitment will undermine Parliament’s
ability to obtain credit on favorable terms
lenders will become more confident that
Parliament will honor its debts
Parliament has the legal authority to end the
commitment at any time
the commercial interests represented by
Parliament will disapprove of the commitment
the commitment will increase Parliament’s
legal power

27. Which one of the following claims would be accepted
by North and Weingast but not by the author of the
passage?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

After 1688, commercial interests in England
trusted Parliament to protect their property rights.
The paradox of omnipotence is no longer a
practical problem for any actual government.
In England, the Crown was able to borrow
money at lower interest rates after the
Glorious Revolution than before.
In the seventeenth century, English and
French monarchs had a reputation for failing
to uphold financial commitments.
The constitutional settlement imposed by the
Glorious Revolution solved the problem of
sovereign omnipotence.

25 Questions

Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Planting peach trees on their farm makes more sense for
the Johnsons than planting apricot trees. Although fresh,
locally grown apricots are very popular in this area, the
same is true of peaches. However, individual peach trees
cost much less to purchase and plant than do apricot
trees, and peach trees also begin bearing fruit at a much
younger age.
Which one of the following, if true, would most
seriously weaken the argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Fresh, locally grown apricots sell at a much
higher price than do fresh, locally grown
peaches.
Apricot trees tend to stop being productive at
a younger age than do peach trees.
It costs as much to water and fertilize
peach trees as it does to water and fertilize
apricot trees.
The market for fresh, locally grown apricots
has grown in recent years as awareness of
the health benefits of eating fresh fruit has
increased.
Peach production has decreased dramatically
over the last several years.

2. For years, a rare variety of camel was endangered
because much of its habitat was used as a weapons
testing range. After the testing range closed, however,
the population of these camels began falling even
more quickly.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the increased rate of population loss?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The weapons tests had kept wildlife poachers
out of the testing range.
Weapons testing in the range did more harm to
the camels in the first years of the testing than
in later years.
Because of unexploded bombs, the land within
the testing range was still somewhat dangerous
after the range closed down.
The camels had to overcome two different
outbreaks of disease during the time the
testing range was in operation.
The weapons tests were most harmful to the
camels in years when food was scarce.

3. A person reading a new book for pleasure is like a
tourist traveling to a new place. The reader reads, just
as the tourist travels, to enlarge understanding rather
than simply to acquire information. Thus, it is better to
read fewer books and spend more time on each rather
than to quickly read as many as one can, just as it is
better to travel to fewer places and spend more time in
each rather than to spend a small amount of time in
many different places.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Tourists typically learn something about the
places they visit even when they are there
only to relax.
Tourists gain much more understanding of a
place once they have spent several days at that
place than they do in their first few days there.
Many people report that they can learn far more
about a place by visiting it than they can by
reading about it.
Tourists who have read about a place
beforehand tend to stay longer in that place.
Some tourists are unconcerned about gaining
information about a place other than what is
necessary for their immediate enjoyment.

4. One way to furnish a living room is with modular
furniture. Instead of buying a standard sofa, for example,
one can buy a left end, a right end, and a middle piece
that can be combined to create an L-shaped sofa.
Modular furniture, however, is far more expensive than
standard furniture. On average, a three-piece modular
sofa costs almost twice as much as a standard sofa of
comparable size and quality.
Each of the following, if true, helps to account for the
greater cost of modular furniture EXCEPT:
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Modular furniture, unlike standard furniture, is
not mass-produced.
The consumer demand for sofas sometimes
increases more quickly than the supply.
The most fashionable designers tend to use
modular furniture designs.
Because modular furniture pieces are custom
ordered, they are never put on sale.
Modular sofas, on average, have a greater area
of upholstered surfaces than do standard sofas.

6. The profitability of a business is reduced by anything
that undermines employee morale. This is why paying
senior staff with stock options, which allows them to
earn more when the enterprise prospers, is not a wise
policy because it increases dramatically the difference
in income between senior staff and employees who are
paid only a fixed salary.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)
5. The hormone testosterone protects brain cells from
injury and reduces levels of the protein beta-amyloid
in the brain. Beta-amyloid causally contributes to
Alzheimer’s disease, and people whose brain cells
are susceptible to injury are probably more susceptible
to Alzheimer’s disease. So there is reason to think
that _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

anyone whose brain cells are susceptible to
injury will eventually develop Alzheimer’s
disease
whether a person develops Alzheimer’s
disease is dependent entirely on the level
of beta-amyloid in his or her brain
Alzheimer’s disease leads to a reduction in
testosterone level
only people with Alzheimer’s disease are at
risk for injury to brain cells
a decline in testosterone level puts one at
increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease

-19-

Large income differences between fixed-salary
employees and senior staff tend to undermine
employee morale.
Reductions in the profitability of a company are
usually due to low employee morale.
Business firms that pay senior staff with stock
options are less profitable than other firms.
Reducing the difference in income between
senior staff and employees paid only a fixed
salary invariably increases a company’s
profitability.
Employees whose incomes rise as the profits
of their employers rise are more productive
than those paid only a fixed salary.

7. Antibiotics are standard ingredients in animal feed
because they keep animals healthy and increase meat
yields. However, scientists have recommended phasing
out this practice, believing it may make antibiotics less
effective in humans. If meat yields are reduced,
however, some farmers will go out of business.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

If scientists are correct that antibiotic use in
animal feed makes antibiotics less effective
in humans, then some farmers will go out
of business.
If antibiotic use in animal feed is not phased
out, some antibiotics will become ineffective
in humans.
If the scientists’ recommendation is not heeded,
no farmers will go out of business due to
reduced meat yields.
If the health of their animals declines, most
farmers will not be able to stay in business.
If antibiotic use in animal feed is phased out,
some farmers will go out of business unless
they use other means of increasing meat yields.

8. Guideline: It is improper for public officials to influence
the award of contracts or to perform other acts
related to their office in a way that benefits
themselves. Even the appearance of such
impropriety should be avoided.
Application: Greenville’s mayor acted improperly in
urging the award of the city’s street maintenance
contract to a company owned and operated by
one of the mayor’s relatives, whose business
would have been in serious financial trouble
had it not been awarded the contract.
Which one of the following principles most helps in
justifying the application of the guideline?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Public officials, when fulfilling their duties,
should be held to higher standards than
private individuals.
Publicly funded contracts should be awarded
based primarily on cost and the reliability of
the contractor.
Creating the appearance of impropriety is as
blameworthy as acting improperly.
Awarding a contract to a financially troubled
business should be regarded as taking
excessive risk.
Benefiting one’s family or friends should be
regarded as benefiting oneself.

9. To use the pool at City Gym, one must have a
membership there. Sarah has a membership at
City Gym. She must therefore use the pool there at
least occasionally.
The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the
argument
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

mistakes a policy that is strictly enforced for
a policy to which exceptions are made
treats a statement whose truth is required for
the conclusion to be true as though it were
a statement whose truth ensures that the
conclusion is true
presumes that one or the other of two alternatives
must be the case without establishing that no
other alternative is possible
concludes that a person has a certain attribute
simply because that person belongs to a group
most of whose members have that attribute
draws a conclusion that merely restates a claim
presented in support of that conclusion

10. Annie: Our university libraries have been sadly
neglected. Few new books have been purchased
during the last decade, and most of the older
books are damaged. The university’s
administrators should admit that their library
policies have been in error and should remedy
this situation in the fastest way possible, which is
to charge students a library fee and use the funds
for library improvements.
Matilda: The current poor condition of the university
libraries is the fault of the library officials, not
the students. Students should not have to pay for
the mistakes of careless library administrators.
Annie and Matilda disagree about whether
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

library administrators are to blame for the poor
condition of the university libraries
library improvements could be most quickly
effected through charging students additional
fees
students will ultimately benefit from the library
improvements that could be funded by
additional student fees
those not responsible for the current condition
of the libraries should bear the cost for
remedying it
funds for library improvements could be raised
without additional student fees

11. Scientists examined diamonds that were formed on
Earth about 2.9 billion years ago. These diamonds had
a higher-than-normal concentration of sulfur-33. This
concentration can be explained only by certain chemical
reactions that are stimulated by ultraviolet light. If there
had been more than a trace of oxygen in Earth’s
atmosphere 2.9 billion years ago, then not enough
ultraviolet light would have reached Earth’s surface to
stimulate the chemical reactions.
The information above most strongly supports which
one of the following?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Most diamonds with higher-than-normal
concentrations of sulfur-33 were formed at
least 2.9 billion years ago.
Ultraviolet light causes the oxygen in Earth’s
atmosphere to react chemically with sulfur-33.
Earth’s atmosphere contained very little, if any,
oxygen 2.9 billion years ago.
Sulfur-33 is rarely found in diamonds that were
formed more recently than 2.9 billion years ago.
The formation of diamonds occurs only in the
presence of ultraviolet light.

12. When a patient failed to respond to prescribed
medication, the doctor hypothesized that the dosage was
insufficient. The doctor first advised doubling the
dosage, but the patient’s symptoms remained. It was
then learned that the patient regularly drank an herbal
beverage that often inhibits the medication’s effect.
The doctor then advised the patient to resume the initial
dosage and stop drinking the beverage. The patient
complied, but still showed no change. Finally, the
doctor advised the patient to double the dosage and not
drink the beverage. The patient’s symptoms disappeared.
Hence, the doctor’s initial hypothesis was correct.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
the manner in which the doctor’s second set of
recommendations and the results of its application
support the doctor’s initial hypothesis?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

They establish that the doctor’s concerns
about the healthfulness of the beverage were
well founded.
They make it less plausible that the beverage
actually contributed to the ineffectiveness of
the prescribed medication.
They give evidence that the beverage was
responsible for the ineffectiveness of the
prescribed medication.
They suggest that the beverage was not the
only cause of the ineffectiveness of the
prescribed dosage.
They rule out the possibility that the doctor
had initially prescribed the wrong medication
for the patient’s ailments.

13. Although most builders do not consider the
experimental building material papercrete to be a
promising material for large-scale construction, those
who regularly work with it, primarily on small-scale
projects, think otherwise. Since those who regularly use
papercrete are familiar with the properties of the
material, it is likely that papercrete is indeed promising
for large-scale construction.
The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the
grounds that it
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

confuses what is promising for small-scale
construction with what is promising for
large-scale construction
presumes that what the majority of builders
thinks is promising must in fact be promising
equivocates between two different meanings of
the term “promising”
does not consider the views of the builders
who have the most experience working with
the material
fails to consider that most builders might not
regularly use papercrete precisely because
they are familiar with its properties

14. Drama critic: There were many interesting plays written
last year. Surely some will gain widespread
popularity for at least a few years, and some will
even receive high critical acclaim, but none will
be popular several centuries from now. The only
plays that continue to be performed regularly over
many decades and centuries are those that
skillfully explore human nature, and none of the
plays written last year examine human nature in
a particularly skillful way.

16. Marife: That was a bad movie because, by not
providing viewers with all the information
necessary for solving the murder, it violated a
requirement of murder mysteries.
Nguyen: But the filmmaker wanted viewers to focus
on the complex relationship between the chief
detective and her assistant. The murder just
provided the context in which the relationship
developed, and should not be taken as a defining
characteristic of the film.

The argument relies on assuming which one of the
following?

Marife’s and Nguyen’s comments indicate that they
disagree about

(A)

(A)
(B)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

No play will be popular several centuries from
now unless it continues to be performed
regularly during the intervening time.
For a play to deserve high critical acclaim it
must be popular for more than just a few years.
There were no plays written last year that the
drama critic has neither read nor seen performed.
If a play does not skillfully explore human
nature, it will not receive critical acclaim.
Any play that skillfully examines human nature
will be performed regularly over the centuries.

15. Doctor: It is wrong for medical researchers to keep their
research confidential, even if the companies for
which they work would rather that they do so. If
research results are not shared, the development
of effective medical treatments may be delayed,
and thus humans may suffer unnecessarily.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the doctor’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Medical researchers should never engage in
any behavior that they know will cause
humans to suffer.
If the most important moral principle is to
prevent human suffering, then it is wrong for
medical researchers to keep their research
confidential.
Medical researchers should not keep
information confidential if it is possible that
sharing that information would prevent some
unnecessary human suffering.
Medical researchers should always attempt to
develop effective medical treatments as
rapidly as they can while fulfilling their other
moral obligations.
It is wrong for any company to ask its medical
researchers to keep their research confidential,
if failure to share the research might delay
development of effective medical treatments.

(D)
(E)

whether the movie was a bad one
whether the relationship between the chief
detective and her assistant was an important
part of the movie
whether the movie should be classified as a
murder mystery

that all mystery movies must meet
whether the filmmaker wanted viewers to be
able to solve the murder

17. Educator: Some experimental educational programs,
based on the principle that children’s first
education should take place at home, instruct
parents in how to be their child’s “first teacher.”
The school performance of the children in these
programs is better than average. This shows
that these programs are successful and should
be expanded.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
educator’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Not all small children enjoy being taught by
their parents.
Most of the parents participating in the
programs have prior experience as educators.
Surveys show that most parents would approve
expanding the programs.
The cost of expanding the programs has not
been precisely determined.
Some children who did not participate in the
programs performed exceptionally well in school.

19. In 1996, all ResearchTech projects were funded either
by the government or by private corporations. The
Gilman Survey, a ResearchTech project, was not funded
by the government but was conducted in 1996. It must
therefore have been funded by private corporations.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the censor’s reasoning?

Which one of the following is most similar in its
reasoning to the argument above?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If a novel has a subversive outlook but does
not depict wholesale violence, it is
impermissible to ban it.
If a novel depicts wholesale violence, then it is
permissible to ban it if doing so would do
more good than harm to society.
It is permissible to ban a novel only if the
novel has a subversive outlook and would do
more harm than good to society.
It is permissible to ban a novel that would
cause society more harm than good if the
novel has two or more objectionable
characteristics.
It is permissible to ban a novel that depicts
wholesale violence only if that novel has at
least one other objectionable characteristic.

Legal restrictions on consumer purchases have
a variety of aims; for example, some are
paternalistic, and others are designed to protect
civil liberties. Ordinance 304, a legal
restriction on alcohol sales, does not protect
civil liberties. It must therefore be paternalistic.
Legal restrictions on consumer purchases, such
as Ordinance 304, are either paternalistic or
protect civil liberties. Ordinance 304 is not
paternalistic, so it must protect civil liberties.
Ordinance 304 is not paternalistic. Since all
legal restrictions on consumer purchases are
either paternalistic or designed to protect the
environment, the purpose of Ordinance 304
must not be to protect the environment.
Legal restrictions on consumer purchases are
either paternalistic or designed to protect civil
liberties. All ordinances passed in 1993 are
paternalistic. Since Ordinance 304 was passed
in 1993, it must be a legal restriction on
consumer purchases.
Ordinance 304 should be exercised only in
order to protect civil liberties or to protect
consumers from self-harm. The mayor’s last
exercise of Ordinance 304 does not protect
civil liberties, so it must have been intended
to protect consumers from self-harm.

20. Astronomer: Earth was bombarded repeatedly by
comets and asteroids early in its history. This
bombardment probably sterilized the surface and
prevented life from originating during this early
period in Earth’s geological history. Meanwhile,
Mars escaped severe bombardment, and so there
could have been microbial life on Mars prior to
there being such life on Earth. Because many
meteorites originating from Mars have landed
on Earth, life on Earth may have started when
living microbes were carried here from Mars
on a meteorite.

the role played in the astronomer’s argument by the
statement that there could have been microbial life

21. The presence of bees is necessary for excellent
pollination, which, in turn, usually results in abundant
fruits and vegetables. Establishing a beehive or two
near one’s garden ensures the presence of bees.
Keeping bees is economical, however, only if the
gardener has a use for homegrown honey. Thus,
gardeners who have no use for homegrown honey will
tend not to have beehives, so their gardens will fail to
have excellent pollination.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The argument fails to consider the possibility
that obtaining homegrown honey is only one
of several advantages of beehives.
The argument confuses what is necessary for
pollination to take place with what would
guarantee that it takes place.
The argument confuses what is necessary for
an abundance of fruits and vegetables with
what is usually conducive to it.
The argument fails to consider that bees might
be present even in the absence of a particular
condition that would ensure their presence.
The argument bases a claim that there is a
causal connection between beehives and
excellent pollination on a mere association
between them.

22. People often praise poems for their truth. But to argue
that expressing true propositions contributes to the
aesthetic merit of a poem is misguided. Most of the
commonplace beliefs of most people are true. Whatever
the basis of poetic excellence is, it must certainly be
rare rather than common.

(C)
(D)

It is the overall conclusion drawn by the
argument.
It is a premise that, in conjunction with
another premise, is intended to support the

It is a premise offered as the sole support for
the argument’s conclusion.
It is background information that, in itself,
does not provide support for the argument’s

24. Why are violins made by Stradivarius in the early 1700s
far superior to most other violins? Some experts suggest
secret varnishes, but there is no evidence for this.
However, climatologists have found that in the 1600s
and early 1700s weather patterns in the region of Italy
where Stradivarius worked affected tree growth to
produce wood with special acoustic properties.
Therefore, it is likely that _______.

25. Principle: Only if a professor believes a student
knowingly presented someone else’s ideas
without attribution should the professor make
an official determination that the student has
committed plagiarism.
Application: It is not the case that Professor Serfin
should make an official determination that
Walters committed plagiarism in the term paper
about Willa Cather that Walters wrote for
Serfin’s class.
Which one of the following, if true, justifies the above
application of the principle?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

some other Italian violin makers in the early
1700s produced violins that equaled the
quality of Stradivarius violins
Stradivarius was the only violin maker in the
early 1700s to use the wood produced in that
part of Italy
no violin made from present-day materials could
rival a Stradivarius violin for sound quality
the special qualities of Stradivarius violins are
due in part to the wood used to make them
Stradivarius did not employ any secret
techniques in making his violins

Professor Serfin does not have completely
compelling evidence to conclude that Walters
presented someone else’s ideas as if they were
his own in the term paper about Willa Cather.
If Walters had realized that the main thesis of
his term paper is identical to the main thesis
of a book he had read, Walters would have
attributed the idea to the book.
Although the main thesis of Walters’s term
paper is identical to that of a book that he did
not cite, Professor Serfin is convinced that
Walters did not knowingly try to pass anyone
else’s ideas off as his own.
Walters does not believe that Professor Serfin
should make an official determination that
he plagiarized.
Professor Serfin has no intention of making an
official determination that Walters plagiarized
in the class.

SECTION IV

Time—35 minutes
25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Economist: Prosperity is a driving force behind
increases in the release of carbon dioxide, the
main cause of global warming. As incomes rise,
more people spend money on energy-consuming
devices such as cars, thereby producing more
carbon dioxide. Also, in countries that experienced
deep economic recessions, there were steep drops
in carbon dioxide emissions.
Which one of the following most accurately states the
overall conclusion drawn in the economist’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Carbon dioxide is the main cause of global
warming.
Prosperity is an important cause of increases in
the release of carbon dioxide.
When incomes rise, more people spend money
on energy-consuming devices.
Countries that experienced deep economic
recessions also experienced steep drops in
carbon dioxide emissions.
When people spend money on
energy-consuming devices, more carbon
dioxide is produced as a result.

2. Spokesperson: Contrary to what some have claimed,
our group’s “Clean City” campaign has been a
rousing success. After all, the amount of trash on
the city’s streets today is significantly lower than
when the campaign began.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the spokesperson’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The amount of trash on the city’s streets was
not declining at the same rate or faster
before the campaign began than it did
during the campaign.
Those who claim that the campaign has not
been a rousing success are unaware of the
degree of the decline in the amount of trash
since the campaign began.
The campaign has been more successful in
reducing the amount of trash on the city’s
streets than has any other campaign in the past.
The spokesperson’s group did not receive any
special funding to support the planning or
execution of the campaign.
The amount of trash on the city’s streets has
declined steadily throughout the course of
the campaign.

3. Consumption of sugar affects the level of unmetabolized
sugar in the blood; the level rises following consumption
of sugar. Yet people who consume large amounts of
sugar tend to have below-average levels of unmetabolized
sugar in their blood.
Which one of the following, if true, helps most to
resolve the apparent paradox described above?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Persons who are overweight tend to have
below-average levels of unmetabolized sugar
in their blood.
Fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy products
often contain as much sugar as sweets.
Consuming large amounts of sugar causes the
body to secrete abnormally high amounts of
insulin, a sugar-metabolizing enzyme.
Consuming large amounts of sugar can lead
eventually to the failure of the body to produce
enough insulin, a sugar-metabolizing enzyme.
Sugar passes into the bloodstream before it can
be metabolized.

4. An economist has argued that consumers often benefit
when government permits a corporation to obtain a
monopoly. Without competition, a corporation can raise
prices without spending nearly as much on advertising.
The corporation can then invest the extra money in
expensive research or industrial infrastructure that it
could not otherwise afford, passing the fruits of these
investments on to consumers.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the economist’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The benefits to consumers are typically greater
if a corporation invests in expensive research
or industrial infrastructure than if that
corporation spends the same amount of
money in any other way.
The government’s permitting a corporation to
obtain a monopoly is advantageous for
consumers only if that corporation passes the
fruits of at least some of its investments on
to consumers.
If a corporation obtains a monopoly, the
disadvantage to consumers of any higher prices
will be outweighed by the advantages from
extra investments in expensive research or
industrial infrastructure made by that corporation.
Even if a corporation is not permitted to obtain
a monopoly, it typically invests some money in
expensive research or industrial infrastructure.
If obtaining a monopoly enables a corporation
to raise its prices and invest less money in
advertising, that corporation will almost
inevitably do so.

5. A natural history museum contains several displays of
wild animals. These displays are created by drying and
mounting animal skins. In some of the older displays,
the animals’ skins have started to deteriorate because
of low humidity and the heat of the lights. The older
displays are lit by tungsten lamps but the newer ones
are lit by compact fluorescent lamps designed for use
in museums. These lamps give off as much light as the
tungsten lamps but less heat.

4

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Some of the older displays will last longer if
the tungsten lamps that illuminate them are
replaced by compact fluorescent lamps.
The displays that are lit by many compact
fluorescent lamps are more prone to
deterioration than the displays that are lit by
a few tungsten lamps.
More of the displays are lit by compact
fluorescent lamps than are lit by tungsten lamps.
The newer displays will not be subject to
deterioration because of low humidity.
The humidity in the museum is lower today
than it was when the older displays were first
put in place.

6. Columnist: Contrary to what many people believe,
the number of species on Earth is probably not
dwindling. Extinction is a natural process, and
about as many species are likely to go extinct this
year as went extinct in 1970. But the emergence
of new species is also a natural process; there is
no reason to doubt that new species are emerging
at about the same rate as they have been for the
last several centuries.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
columnist’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

In 1970 fewer new species emerged than
went extinct.
The regions of the world where new species
tend to emerge at the highest rate are also
where species tend to go extinct at the
highest rate.
The vast majority of the species that have
ever existed are now extinct.
There is no more concern now about extinction
of species than there was in 1970.
Scientists are now better able to identify species
facing serious risk of extinction than they were
in 1970.

7. Even though MacArthur’s diet book helped many people
lose weight, MacArthur should not have published it.
It recommended such small portions of fruits and
vegetables that it undoubtedly damaged the health of
many who followed the diet. MacArthur is a physician,
so MacArthur either knew or should have known that
diets low in fruits and vegetables are unhealthful.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the argument’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)

(C)

The statements above, if true, most strongly support
which one of the following?
(A)

4

(D)

(E)

One should not undertake an action if one
knows that doing so would seriously damage
the health of many people.
One should not follow a particular method
for achieving some end if doing so has the
potential to damage one’s health.
One should publish a book recommending
certain health-related measures if doing so is
likely to improve many people’s lives without
also causing harm.
One should not publish a book recommending
a particular means of attaining a goal unless
one knows that the particular means can bring
about that goal.
One should not publish a book recommending
a particular course of action if one either
knows or ought to know that taking that
course of action would be unhealthful.

8. Principle: If the burden of a proposed policy change
would fall disproportionately on people with low
incomes, that policy change should not be made.
Application: The city of Centerburgh plans to
reintroduce rock salt as a road de-icing agent,
after having stopped its use several years ago on
the grounds that it accelerated the corrosion of
automobiles. Although the city claims that cars
are now better protected from salt’s corrosive
properties than they were even as recently as
five years ago, the city’s plan should be halted.

10. Economist: In free market systems, the primary
responsibility of corporate executives is to
determine a nation’s industrial technology, the
pattern of work organization, location of industry,
and resource allocation. They also are the
decision makers, though subject to significant
consumer control, on what is to be produced and
in what quantities. In short, a large category of
major decisions is turned over to business
executives. Thus, business executives have
become public officials.

Which one of the following, if true of Centerburgh,
most justifies the above application of the principle?

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
economist’s argument?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Individuals with low incomes are more likely
to use public transportation and are less
likely to drive cars than are individuals
with higher incomes.
Road maintenance is primarily funded by local
sales taxes, which disproportionately burden
people with low incomes.
Cars now cost twice what they did when rock
salt was last used as a road de-icing agent.
People with low incomes are more likely to
purchase older vehicles than are people with
higher incomes.
Among drivers, those with low incomes are
less likely than those with higher incomes
to use roads that have been treated with
de-icing agents.

9. In a medical study of all of the residents of
Groverhill, 35 people reported consulting their
physician last year seeking relief from severe headaches.
Those same physicians’ records, however, indicate that
105 consultations occurred last year with Groverhill
patients seeking relief from severe headaches. Obviously,
then, many residents who consulted physicians for this
condition did not remember doing so.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

generalizes inappropriately from an
unrepresentative sample of residents of
Groverhill
fails to consider whether any residents of
Groverhill visit physicians who are not located
in Groverhill
overlooks the possibility that residents of
Groverhill visited their physicians more than
once during the year for the same condition
fails to provide any evidence to support the
claim that the residents of Groverhill have an
unusually high occurrence of severe headaches
takes for granted that every resident of
Groverhill who suffers from severe headaches
would consult a physician about this condition

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most of the decisions made by business
executives in free market systems are made
by the government in countries with centrally
planned economies.
Making decisions about patterns of work
organization, resource allocation, and
location of industry is not the core of a
public official’s job.
The salaries of business executives are
commensurate with the salaries of highranking public officials.
What a country produces and in what
quantities is not always completely controlled
by corporate executives.
Public officials and business executives
often cooperate in making decisions of
national importance.

11. Science fiction creates an appetite for interstellar space
exploration among certain people. Unfortunately, this
appetite cannot be satisfied with any technology
humanity will soon possess. Since gaps between
expectations and reality spur discontent, no doubt one
effect of science fiction has been to create an
unproductive dissatisfaction with the way the world
actually is.
Which one of the following is an assumption the
argument requires?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The fact that the appetite for interstellar space
exploration cannot be satisfied with any
technology humanity will soon possess has
created a gap between reality and some
people’s expectations.
If science fiction has created an unproductive
dissatisfaction with the way the world actually
is, it has done so only by creating an appetite
for interstellar space exploration among
certain people.
Few if any of the appetites that science fiction
has created in people could be satisfied with
any technology humanity will soon possess.
Most people unrealistically expect that
technology that humanity will soon possess
could satisfy the appetite for interstellar
space exploration.
If the appetites science fiction has created in
people could all be satisfied with technologies
that humanity will soon possess, then science
fiction could not create an unproductive
dissatisfaction with the way the world is.

12. Tamika: Many people have been duped by the claims
of those who market certain questionable medical
products. Their susceptibility is easy to explain:
most people yearn for easy solutions to complex
medical problems but don’t have the medical
knowledge necessary to see through the sellers’
fraudulent claims. However, the same
explanation cannot be given for a recent trend
among medical professionals toward a susceptibility
to fraudulent claims. They, of course, have no
lack of medical knowledge.
Tamika’s argument proceeds by
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

showing by analogy that medical professionals
should not be susceptible to the fraudulent
claims of those who market certain medical
products
arguing against a hypothesis by showing that
the hypothesis cannot account for the behavior
of everyone
explaining the susceptibility of medical
professionals to the fraudulent claims of those
marketing certain medical products by casting
doubt on the expertise of the professionals
arguing that since two groups are disanalogous
in important respects, there must be different
explanations for their similar behavior
arguing that an explanation should be accepted
in spite of apparent evidence against it

13. Business ethicist: Managers of corporations have an
obligation to serve shareholders as the
shareholders would want to be served. Therefore,
corporate managers have an obligation to act in
the shareholders’ best interest.
The business ethicist’s conclusion follows logically if
which one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Corporate managers are always able to discern
what is in the best interest of shareholders.
Shareholders would want to be served only in
ways that are in their own best interest.
A corporate manager’s obligations to
shareholders take precedence over any other
obligations the manager may have.
The shareholders have interests that can best
be served by corporate managers.
All shareholders want to be served in
identical ways.

14. Astronomer: Does a recent meteorite from Mars contain
fossilized bacteria? Professor Tagar, a biologist,
argues that the bacteria-like structures found in
the meteorite cannot be fossilized bacteria, on the
grounds that they are one-tenth of 1 percent the
volume of the smallest earthly bacteria. However,
Tagar’s view cannot be right. Tagar does not
accept the views of biologists Swiderski and
Terrada, who maintain that Martian bacteria
would shrink to one-tenth of 1 percent of their
normal volume when water or other nutrients
were in short supply.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
a flaw in the reasoning in the astronomer’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

The argument presumes, without providing
justification, that the authorities cited have
always held the views attributed to them.
The argument provides no justification for
giving preference to the views of one rather
than the other of two competing sets of
authorities.
The argument takes for granted that the
number of authorities supporting a particular
hypothesis is an indication of how accurate
that hypothesis is.
The argument appeals to views that contradict
rather than support one another.
The argument presumes, without providing
justification, that the opinions of all experts
are equally justified.

16. Professor: Unfortunately, pharmaceutical companies
and other profit-driven institutions provide nearly
all of the funding for the chemistry department’s
research. Moreover, unless we can secure more
funding for basic science research, it is highly
unlikely that any significant advances in basic
research will come out of the department. Thus,
without increased funding from sources other
than profit-driven institutions, the chemistry
department is unlikely to gain the prestige that
only achievements in basic science research confer.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the professor’s argument relies?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)
15. Any good garden compost may appropriately be used
for soil drainage and fertility. The best compost is 40
to 60 percent organic matter and is dark brown in color.
However, compost that emits a strong ammonia smell
should not be used for drainage and fertility, for that
smell means that the organic matter has not sufficiently
decomposed.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Compost that is 80 percent organic matter has
probably not decomposed sufficiently.
If compost is less than 40 percent organic
matter and is not dark brown in color, then it
will make soil less fertile and will worsen
soil drainage.
If compost is 50 percent organic matter and
that organic matter is sufficiently decomposed,
then the compost is good.
In the best garden compost, the organic matter
is completely decomposed.
Compost that is dark brown in color and
emits a strong ammonia smell is not good
garden compost.

If the chemistry department secures more
funding for basic science research, its members
will make significant advances in basic science.
If the chemistry department’s prestige increases
substantially, then it is highly likely that the
department’s funding from sources other than
profit-driven institutions will subsequently
increase.
Members of the chemistry department are
unlikely to make significant advances in basic
science research if the department does not
forego the funding it currently receives from
profit-driven institutions.
The chemistry department’s funding for basic
science research is not likely to increase if its
funding from sources other than profit-driven
institutions does not increase.
The profit-driven institutions that currently
provide almost all of the chemistry
department’s funding are not likely to benefit
from basic scientific research.

17. In order to save money, many consumers redeem
coupons that are distributed by retail stores. However,
in general, retail stores that distribute and accept store
coupons as a way of discounting the prices on certain
products charge more for their products, on average,
than other retail stores charge for the same products—
even after lower prices available on coupon-discounted
products are factored in. This is because producing and
distributing coupons usually costs a great deal.
To compensate for this expense without reducing
profits, retail stores must pass it on to consumers.

18. Psychologist: Birth-order effects, the alleged effects
of when one was born relative to the births of
siblings, have not been detected in studies of adult
personality that use standard personality tests.
However, they have been detected in birth-order
studies that are based on parents’ and siblings’
reports of the subjects’ personalities. All of these
birth-order studies, taken together, show that birth
order has no lasting effect on personality; instead,
birth order affects merely how a sibling’s
behavior is perceived.

Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the information above?

Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the psychologist’s argument?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Many consumers who redeem coupons save
little if any money, overall, by doing so.
Retail stores that distribute coupons generally
compensate for the expense of producing and
distributing coupons by charging higher prices
for certain products.
The profits of retail stores that use coupons are
not significantly lower, on average, than the
profits of similar stores that do not use coupons.
At least some retail stores that do not use
coupons do not have expenses that they pass
on to consumers.
The undiscounted price charged for a good for
which a retail store offers a coupon will be
higher than the price charged for that same
good by a retail store that does not offer a
coupon for it.

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Standard personality tests will detect at least
some birth-order effects on personality, if
those effects exist.
The behavior patterns people display when they
are with family are significantly different from
those they display otherwise.
Parents’ and siblings’ perceptions of a person’s
personality tend not to change between that
person’s early childhood and adulthood.
Standard personality tests have detected
significant birth-order effects in some studies
of young children’s personalities.
Parents and siblings have accurate perceptions
of the behavior patterns of other family
members.

19. If the jury did not return a verdict, there would still be
media trucks outside the courthouse. There are no
media trucks outside the courthouse, so the jury must
have returned a verdict.

The pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most
similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If a hurricane arises off the coast this summer,
our town will see less tourism than usual. But
since there will be no hurricane this summer,
there will be no less tourism than usual.
If Peter did not buy a house, he would have
rented an apartment. Peter did not rent an
apartment, so he must have bought a house.
Renate promised Linus that if his car was not
working, she would drive him to work.
Linus’s car is not working, so Renate must
have driven him to work.
If Kay’s television was not working last night,
she would have gone to a movie. Her
television has not been working for the past
week, so she must have gone to a movie
last night.
If Ralph had told Manuela about the problem,
Manuela would have solved it. But Ralph did
not tell Manuela about the problem, so
someone else must have solved it.

20. A salesperson who makes a sale does not change the
desires of the customer. Rather, the salesperson finds out
what these desires are and then convinces the customer
that a particular product will satisfy them. Persuading
people to vote for a politician to whom they are
initially indifferent is not significantly different. After
discovering what policies the prospective voter would
like to see in place, one tries to _______.

21. Farmer: My neighbor claims that my pesticides are
spreading to her farm in runoff water, but she is
wrong. I use only organic pesticides, and there is
no evidence that they harm either people or
domestic animals. Furthermore, I am careful to
avoid spraying on my neighbor’s land.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
a reasoning flaw in the farmer’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It treats lack of evidence that organic pesticides
harm people or domestic animals as proof that
they cannot do so.
It presumes, without providing justification,
that being careful to avoid something usually
results in its avoidance.
It does not address the neighbor’s claim that
pesticides used by the farmer are spreading
onto her land.
It fails to provide an alternative explanation
for the presence of pesticides on the
neighbor’s land.
It ignores the possibility that pesticides might
have dangerous effects other than harming
people or domestic animals.

22. Linguist: One group of art critics claims that
postimpressionist paintings are not really art
and so should be neither studied nor displayed.
Another group of critics disagrees, insisting that
these paintings are works of art. But since the
second group grants that there are paintings that
are not works of art and should therefore be
ignored in the manner suggested by the first group,
their disagreement is not over the meaning of the
word “art.”

Which one of the following most logically completes
the argument?

The claim that there are paintings that are not works
of art plays which one of the following roles in the
linguist’s argument?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

show that the opponents of the politician in
question do not favor all of those policies
disguise any difference between the policies the
politician supports and the policies supported
by other candidates
convince the voter that the policies favored by
the politician in question are preferable to
those favored by the voter
demonstrate that the politician is a person of
outstanding character and is interested in some
of the same issues as the voter
persuade the voter that voting for the politician
in question is the best way to get these
policies adopted

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is a contention that the argument purports to
show is the main point of disagreement
between the two groups of critics mentioned.
It is cited as a commonly accepted reason for
accepting a hypothesis for which the argument
offers independent evidence.
It is a claim whose acceptance by critics who
differ on other issues is cited by the argument
as evidence of its truth.
It is a claim about the nature of art that
according to the argument accounts for
disputes that only appear to concern the
aesthetic merits of certain types of paintings.
It is a claim whose acceptance by both of the
two disputing parties is cited as evidence for
a conclusion the argument draws about the
disagreement.

23. Biologists found that off the northeast coast of a certain
country the P-plankton population has recently dropped
10 percent. Additionally, fish species X, Y, and Z are
beginning to show extraordinarily high death rates in
the region. Since these species of fish are known to
sometimes eat P-plankton, biologists believe the two
phenomena are connected, but the exact nature of the
connection is unknown. No other species in the
ecosystem appear to be affected.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the biologists’ findings?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Several major pharmaceutical companies in the
region have been secretly dumping large amounts
of waste into the ocean for many years.
A new strain of bacteria is attacking P-plankton
by destroying their cell walls and is attacking
the respiratory systems of fish species X, Y,
and Z.
A powerful toxin in the water is killing off
P-plankton by inhibiting their production of
a chemical they use in reproduction.
Fish species X, Y, and Z are all experiencing
widespread starvation within the affected
region, and the loss of P-plankton is driving
their death rates up even higher.
Global warming has changed the climatic
conditions of the ocean all along the northeast
coast of the country.

24. Nightbird is an unsigned painting that some attribute
to the celebrated artist Larocque. Experts agree that it
was painted in a style indistinguishable from that of
Larocque and that if it was not painted by Larocque,
it was undoubtedly painted by one of his students.
A recent analysis showed that the painting contains
orpiment, a pigment never yet found in a work
attributed to Larocque. Therefore, the painting must
have been done by one of Larocque’s students.

25. Advertisement: The dental profession knows that
brushing with Blizzard toothpaste is the best way
to fight cavities. We surveyed five dentists, and
each agreed that the tartar control formula found
in Blizzard is the most effective cavity-fighting
formula available in a toothpaste.
The flawed reasoning in which one of the following is
most similar to the flawed reasoning in the advertisement?
(A)

The nation’s voters know that Gomez is the
candidate whose policies would be best for the
nation. Of ten voters polled, each said that
Gomez would be a very popular leader.
Some of the nation’s voters believe that Gomez is
the candidate who would be best for the nation.
Of the ten voters we surveyed, each agreed that
the policies Gomez is committed to would be the
best policies for the nation to adopt.
The nation’s voters generally believe that
Gomez is the candidate who would be best
for the nation. We polled thousands of voters
in the nation, and they agreed that the policies
Gomez is committed to would help the nation
more than those supported by any of the
other candidates.
The nation’s voters know that electing Gomez
would be the best way to help the nation.
The ten voters we polled all agreed that the
policies Gomez is committed to would help
the nation more than any other policies.
We know that electing Gomez would be the
best course for the nation to follow because,
of ten voters we surveyed, each agreed that
electing Gomez would help the nation.

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens
the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Few of Larocque’s students ever used painting
techniques that differed from Larocque’s.
Larocque never signed any of his paintings.
No painting currently recognized as the work of
one of Larocque’s students contains orpiment.
None of Larocque’s students is considered to be
an important artist.
The use of orpiment became more popular in
the years after Larocque’s death.
