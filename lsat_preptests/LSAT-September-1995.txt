24 Questions

Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some questions,
more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that is, the response
that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by commonsense standards
implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1.

The city’s center for disease control reports that the
rabies epidemic is more serious now than it was two
years ago: two years ago less than 25 percent of the
local raccoon population was infected, whereas today
the infection has spread to more than 50 percent of the
raccoon population. However, the newspaper reports
that whereas two years ago 32 cases of rabid raccoons
were conﬁrmed during a 12-month period, in the
past 12 months only 18 cases of rabid raccoons were
conﬁrmed.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
resolve the apparent discrepancy between the two
reports?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The number of cases of rabies in wild animals
other than raccoons has increased in the past 12
months.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the raccoon
population succumbed to rabies in the year
before last.
The symptoms of distemper, another disease to
which raccoons are susceptible, are virtually
identical to those of rabies.
Since the outbreak of the epidemic, raccoons,
which are normally nocturnal, have increasingly
been seen during daylight hours.
The number of conﬁrmed cases of rabid raccoons
in neighboring cities has also decreased over the
past year.

Recently, reviewers of patent applications decided
against granting a patent to a university for a genetically
engineered mouse developed for laboratory use in
studying cancer. The reviewers argued that the mouse
was a new variety of animal and that rules governing
the granting of patents speciﬁcally disallow patents for
new animal varieties.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens
the patent reviewers’ argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The restrictions the patent reviewers cited
pertain only to domesticated farm animals.
The university’s application for a patent for the
genetically engineered mouse was the ﬁrst such
patent application made by the university.
The patent reviewers had reached the same
decision on all previous patent requests for new
animal varieties.
The patent reviewers had in the past approved
patents for genetically engineered plant
varieties.
The patent reviewers had previously decided
against granting patents for new animal varieties
that were developed through conventional
breeding programs rather than through genetic
engineering.

Questions 3-4

5.

Although water in deep aquifers does not contain
disease-causing bacteria, when public water supplies are
drawn from deep aquifers, chlorine is often added to the
water as a disinfectant because contamination can occur as
a result of ﬂaws in pipes or storage tanks. Of 50
municipalities that all pumped water from the same deep
aquifer, 30 chlorinated their water and 20 did not. The
water in all of the municipalities met the regional
government’s standards for cleanliness, yet the water
supplied by the 20 municipalities that did not chlorinate had
less bacterial contamination than the water supplied by the
municipalities that added chlorine.
3.

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)
4.

A municipality’s initial decision whether or
not to use chlorine is based on the amount of
bacterial contamination in the water source.
Water in deep aquifers does not contain any
bacteria of any kind.
Where accessible, deep aquifers are the best
choice as a source for a municipal water supply.
The regional government’s standards allow some
bacteria in municipal water supplies.
Chlorine is the least effective disinfecting agent.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps explain
the difference in bacterial contamination in the two
groups of municipalities?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Chlorine is considered by some experts to be
dangerous to human health, even in the small
concentrations used in municipal water supplies.
When municipalities decide not to chlorinate
their water supplies, it is usually because their
citizens have voiced objections to the taste and
smell of chlorine.
The municipalities that did not add chlorine to
their water supplies also did not add any of the
other available water disinfectants, which are
more expensive than chlorine.
Other agents commonly added to public
water supplies, such as ﬂuoride and sodium
hydroxide, were not used by any of the 50
municipalities.
Municipalities that do not chlorinate their water
supplies are subject to stricter regulation by
the regional government in regard to pipes and
water tanks than are municipalities that use
chlorine.

The population of songbirds throughout England has
decreased in recent years. Many people explain this
decrease as the result of an increase during the same
period in the population of magpies, which eat the eggs
and chicks of songbirds.
Which one of the following, if true, argues most
strongly against the explanation reported in the
passage?
(A)
(B)

Which one of the following can properly be concluded
from the information given above?
(A)

2

2 2

(C)

(D)

(E)

6.

Ofﬁcial records of the population of birds in
England have been kept for only the past 30
years.
The number of eggs laid yearly by a female
songbird varies widely according to the
songbird’s species.
Although the overall population of magpies has
increased, in most areas of England in which the
songbird population has decreased, the number
of magpies has remained stable.
The population of magpies has increased because
farmers no longer shoot or trap magpies to
any great extent, though farmers still consider
magpies to be pests.
Although magpies eat the eggs and chicks of
songbirds, magpies’ diets consist of a wide
variety of other foods as well.

The introduction of symbols for numbers is an event
lost in prehistory, but the earliest known number
symbols, in the form of simple grooves and scratches
on bones and stones, date back 20,000 years or more.
Nevertheless, since it was not until 5,500 years ago that
systematic methods for writing numerals were invented,
it was only then that any sort of computation became
possible.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument relies?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Grooves and scratches found on bones and stones
were all made by people, and none resulted
from natural processes.
Some kinds of surfaces upon which numeric
symbols could have been made in the period
before 5,500 years ago were not used for that
purpose.
Grooves and scratches inscribed on bones and
stones do not date back to the time of the
earliest people.
Computation of any sort required a systematic
method for writing numerals.
Systematic methods for writing numerals were
invented only because the need for computation
arose.

Politician: Now that we are ﬁnally cleaning up the
industrial pollution in the bay, we must start
making the bay more accessible to the public for
recreational purposes.
Reporter: But if we increase public access to the bay,
it will soon become polluted again.
Politician: Not true. The public did not have access to
the bay, and it got polluted. Therefore, if and when
the public is given access to the bay, it will not get
polluted.

Because learned patterns of behavior, such as
the association of a green light with “go” or the
expectation that switches will ﬂip up for “on,”
become deeply ingrained, designers should make
allowances for that fact, in order not to produce
machines that are inefﬁcient or dangerous. In
which one of the following situations is the
principle expressed most clearly violated?
Manufacturers have refused to change the standard
order of letters on the typewriter keyboard even
though some people who have never learned to
type ﬁnd this arrangement of letters bewildering.
Government regulations require that crucial
instruments in airplane cockpits be placed

From 1973 to 1989 total energy use in this country
increased less than 10 percent. However, the use of
electrical energy in this country during this same period
grew by more than 50 percent, as did the gross national
product—the total value of all goods and services
produced in the nation.
If the statements above are true, then which one of the
following must also be true?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Most of the energy used in this country in 1989
was electrical energy.
From 1973 to 1989 there was a decline in the
use of energy other than electrical energy in this
country.
From 1973 to 1989 there was an increase in the
proportion of energy use in this country that
consisted of electrical energy use.
In 1989 electrical energy constituted a larger
proportion of the energy used to produce the
gross national product than did any other form
of energy.
In 1973 the electrical energy that was produced
constituted a smaller proportion of the gross
national product than did all other forms of
energy combined.

10. A fundamental illusion in robotics is the belief that
improvements in robots will liberate humanity from
“hazardous and demeaning work.” Engineers are
designing only those types of robots that can be
properly maintained with the least expensive, least
skilled human labor possible. Therefore, robots will not
eliminate demeaning work
workonly substitute one type of
demeaning work for another.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to the
criticism that it
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

ignores the consideration that in a competitive
business environment some jobs might
be eliminated if robots are not used in the
manufacturing process
assumes what it sets out to prove, that robots
create demeaning work
does not specify whether or not the engineers
who design robots consider their work
demeaning
attempts to support its conclusion by an appeal to
the emotion of fear, which is often experienced
by people faced with the prospect of losing their
jobs to robots
fails to address the possibility that the amount of
demeaning work eliminated by robots might be
signiﬁcantly greater than the amount they create

11. If the needle on an industrial sewing machine becomes
badly worn, the article being sewn can be ruined. In
traditional apparel factories, the people who operate the
sewing machines monitor the needles and replace those
that begin to wear out. Industrial sewing operations
are becoming increasingly automated, however, and
it would be inefﬁcient for a factory to hire people for
the sole purpose of monitoring needles. Therefore a
sophisticated new acoustic device that detects wear in
sewing machine needles is expected to become standard
equipment in the automated apparel factories of the
future.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

In automated apparel factories, items will be
ruined by faulty needles less frequently than
happens in traditional apparel factories.
In the automated apparel factories of the future,
each employee will perform only one type of
task.
Traditional apparel factories do not use any
automated equipment.
The needles of industrial sewing machines wear
out at unpredictable rates.
As sewing machine needles become worn, the
noise they make becomes increasingly loud.

Questions 12-13
Alexander: The chemical waste dump outside our town
should be cleaned up immediately. Admittedly, it will
be very costly to convert that site into woodland, but
we have a pressing obligation to redress the harm we
have done to local forests and wildlife.
Teresa: But our town’s ﬁrst priority is the health of
its people. So even if putting the dump there was
environmentally disastrous, we should not spend
our resources on correcting it unless it presents a
signiﬁcant health hazard to people. If it does, then we
only need to remove that hazard.
12. Teresa’s statement most closely conforms to which
one of the following principles?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Environmental destruction should be redressed
only if it is in the economic interest of the
community to do so.
Resources should be allocated only to satisfy
goals that have the highest priority.
No expense should be spared in protecting the
community’s health.
Environmental hazards that pose slight health
risks to people should be rectiﬁed if the
technology is available to do so.
It is the community as a whole that should
evaluate the importance of eliminating various
perceived threats to public health.

13. Which one of the following is the point at issue between
Alexander and Teresa?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

whether the maintenance of a chemical waste
dump inﬂicts signiﬁcant damage on forests and
wildlife
whether it is extremely costly to clean up a
chemical waste dump in order to replace it by a
woodland
whether the public should be consulted in
determining the public health risk posed by a
chemical waste dump
whether the town has an obligation to redress
damage to local forests and wildlife if that
damage poses no signiﬁcant health hazard to
people
whether destroying forests and wildlife in order
to establish a chemical waste dump amounts to
an environmental disaster

14. In 1980, Country A had a per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) that was $5,000 higher than that of
the European Economic Community. By 1990, the
difference, when adjusted for inﬂation, had increased to
$6,000. Since a rising per capita GDP indicates a rising
average standard of living, the average standard of
living in Country A must have risen between 1980 and
1990.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Between 1980 and 1990, Country A and the
European Economic Community experienced
the same percentage increase in population.
Between 1980 and 1990, the average standard of
living in the European Economic Community
fell.
Some member countries of the European
Economic Community had, during the 1980s, a
higher average standard of living than Country
A.
The per capita GDP of the European Economic
Community was not lower by more than $1,000
in 1990 than it had been in 1980.
In 1990, no member country of the European
Economic Community had a per capita GDP
higher than that of Country A.

15. Municipal ofﬁcials originally estimated that it would be
six months before municipal road crews could complete
repaving a stretch of road. The ofﬁcials presumed
that private contractors could not ﬁnish any sooner.
However, when the job was assigned to a private
contractor, it was completed in just 28 days.
Which one of the following, if true, does most to
resolve the discrepancy between the time estimated
for completion of the repaving job, and the actual time
taken by the private contractor?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Road repaving work can only be done in the
summer months of June, July, and August.
The labor union contract for road crews
employed by both municipal agencies and
private contractors stipulates that employees can
work only eight hours a day, ﬁve days a week,
before being paid overtime.
Many road-crew workers for private contractors
have previously worked for municipal road
crews, and vice versa.
Private contractors typically assign 25 workers to
each road-repaving job site, whereas the number
assigned to municipal road crews is usually 30.
Municipal agencies must conduct a lengthy
bidding process to procure supplies after

16. Researchers in South Australia estimate changes in
shark populations inhabiting local waters by monitoring
what is termed the “catch per unit effort” (CPUE). The
CPUE for any species of shark is the number of those
sharks that commercial shark-ﬁshing boats catch per
hour for each kilometer of gill net set out in the water.
Since 1973 the CPUE for a particular species of shark
has remained fairly constant. Therefore, the population
of that species in the waters around South Australia
must be at approximately its 1973 level.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The waters around South Australia are the
only area in the world where that particular
species of shark is found.
The sharks that are the most proﬁtable to catch
are those that tend to remain in the same area of
ocean year after year and not migrate far from
where they were born.
A signiﬁcant threat to shark populations,
in addition to commercial shark ﬁshing, is
“incidental mortality” that results from catching
sharks in nets intended for other ﬁsh.
Most of the quotas designed to protect shark
populations limit the tonnage of sharks that
can be taken and not the number of individual
sharks.
Since 1980 commercial shark-ﬁshing boats
have used sophisticated electronic equipment
that enables them to locate sharks with greater
accuracy.

Questions 17-18
Winston: The Public Transportation Authority (PTA)
cannot fulﬁll its mandate to operate without a budget
deﬁcit unless it eliminates service during late-night
periods of low ridership. Since the fares collected
during these periods are less than the cost of providing
the service, these cuts would reduce the deﬁcit and
should be made. Transit law prohibits unauthorized
fare increases, and fare-increase authorization would
take two years.
Ping: Such service cuts might cost the PTA more in lost
fares than they would save in costs, for the PTA would
lose those riders who leave home during the day but
must return late at night. Thus the PTA would lose two
fares, while realizing cost savings for only one leg of
such trips.

19. The Volunteers for Literacy Program would beneﬁt if
Dolores takes Victor’s place as director, since Dolores
is far more skillful than Victor is at securing the kind
of ﬁnancial support the program needs and Dolores
does not have Victor’s propensity for alienating the
program’s most dedicated volunteers.
The pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most
closely paralleled in which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

17. The relationship of Ping’s response to Winston’s
argument is that Ping’s response
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

carefully redeﬁnes a term used in Winston’s
argument
questions Winston’s proposal by raising
considerations not addressed by Winston
supplies a premise that could have been used as
part of the support for Winston’s argument
introduces detailed statistical evidence that is
more persuasive than that offered by Winston
proposes a solution to the PTA’s dilemma by
contradicting Winston’s conclusion

18. Which one of the following, if true, most strongly
supports Ping’s conclusion?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Over 23 percent of the round trips made by PTA
riders are either initiated or else completed
during late-night periods.
Reliable survey results show that over 43 percent
of the PTA’s riders oppose any cut in PTA
services.
The last time the PTA petitioned for a 15 percent
fare increase, the petition was denied.
The PTA’s budget deﬁcit is 40 percent larger this
year than it was last year.
The PTA’s bus drivers recently won a new
contract that guarantees them a signiﬁcant cash
bonus each time they work the late-night shifts.

(E)

It would be more convenient for Dominique to
take a bus to school than to take the subway,
since the bus stops closer to her house than does
the subway and, unlike the subway, the bus goes
directly to the school.
Joshua’s interest would be better served by
taking the bus to get to his parent’s house rather
than by taking an airplane, since his primary
concern is to travel as cheaply as possible and
taking the bus is less expensive than going by
airplane.
Belinda will get to the concert more quickly
by subway than by taxi, since the concert
takes place on a Friday evening and on
Friday evenings trafﬁc near the concert hall is
exceptionally heavy.
Anita would beneﬁt ﬁnancially by taking the
train to work rather than driving her car, since
when she drives she has to pay parking fees and
the daily fee for parking a car is higher than a
round-trip train ticket.
It would be to Fred’s advantage to exchange his
bus tickets for train tickets, since he needs to
arrive at his meeting before any of the other
participants and if he goes by bus at least one of
the other participants will arrive ﬁrst.

20. Students from outside the province of Markland, who
in any given academic year pay twice as much tuition
each as do students from Markland, had traditionally
accounted for at least two-thirds of the enrollment
at Central Markland College. Over the past 10 years
academic standards at the college have risen, and the
proportion of students who are not Marklanders has
dropped to around 40 percent.
Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the statements above?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

If it had not been for the high tuition paid by
students from outside Markland, the college
could not have improved its academic standards
over the past 10 years.
If academic standards had not risen over the past
10 years, students who are not Marklanders
would still account for at least two-thirds of the
college’s enrollment.
Over the past 10 years, the number of students
from Markland increased and the number of
students from outside Markland decreased.
Over the past 10 years, academic standards at
Central Markland College have risen by more
than academic standards at any other college in
Markland.
If the college’s per capita revenue from tuition
has remained the same, tuition fees have
increased over the past 10 years.

21. Several years ago, as a measure to reduce the
population of gypsy moths, which depend on oak
leaves for food, entomologists introduced into many
oak forests a species of fungus that is poisonous to
gypsy moth caterpillars. Since then, the population
of both caterpillars and adult moths has signiﬁcantly
declined in those areas. Entomologists have concluded
that the decline is attributable to the presence of the
poisonous fungus.
Which one of the following, if true, most strongly
supports the conclusion drawn by the entomologists?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

A strain of gypsy moth whose caterpillars are
unaffected by the fungus has increased its share
of the total gypsy moth population.
The fungus that was introduced to control the
gypsy moth population is poisonous to few
insect species other than the gypsy moth.
An increase in numbers of both gypsy moth
caterpillars and gypsy moth adults followed a
drop in the number of some of the species that
prey on the moths.
In the past several years, air pollution and acid
rain have been responsible for a substantial
decline in oak tree populations.
The current decline in the gypsy moth population
in forests where the fungus was introduced is no
greater than a decline that occurred concurrently
in other forests.

22. Director of personnel: Ms. Tours has formally
requested a salary adjustment on the grounds that
she was denied merit raises to which she was
entitled. Since such grounds provide a possible
basis for adjustments, an ofﬁcial response is
required. Ms. Tours presents compelling evidence
that her job performance has been both excellent
in itself and markedly superior to that of others in
her department who were awarded merit raises.
Her complaint that she was treated unfairly thus
appears justiﬁed. Nevertheless, her request should
be denied. To raise Ms. Tours’s salary because of
her complaint would jeopardize the integrity of
the ﬁrm’s merit-based reward system by sending
the message that employees can get their salaries
raised if they just complain enough.
The personnel director’s reasoning is most vulnerable to
criticism on the grounds that it
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

fails to consider the possibility that Ms. Tours’s
complaint could be handled on an unofﬁcial
basis
attempts to undermine the persuasiveness of Ms.
Tours’s evidence by characterizing it as “mere
complaining”
sidesteps the issue of whether superior job
performance is a suitable basis for awarding
salary increases
ignores the possibility that some of the people
who did receive merit increases were not
entitled to them
overlooks the implications for the integrity of the
ﬁrm’s merit-based reward system of denying
Ms. Tour’ s request

People who are old enough to ﬁght for their
country are old enough to vote for the people
who make decisions about war and peace. This
government clearly regards 17-year-olds as old
enough to ﬁght, so it should acknowledge their
right to vote.

T: Your argument is a good one only to the extent
that ﬁghting and voting are the same kind of
activity. Fighting well requires strength,
muscular coordination, and in a modern army,
instant and automatic response to orders.
Performed responsibly, voting, unlike ﬁghting,

24. The role of the Uplandian supreme court is to protect
all human rights against abuses of government power.
Since the constitution of Uplandia is not explicit about
all human rights, the supreme court must sometimes
resort to principles outside the explicit provisions of
the constitution in justifying its decisions. However,
human rights will be subject to the whim of whoever
holds judicial power unless the supreme court is
bound to adhere to a single objective standard, namely,
the constitution. Therefore, nothing but the explicit
provisions of the constitution can be used to justify
the court’s decisions. Since these conclusions are
inconsistent with each other, it cannot be true that the
role of the Uplandian supreme court is to protect all
human rights against abuses of government power.
The reasoning that leads to the conclusion that the ﬁrst
sentence in the passage is false is ﬂawed because the
argument
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

ignores data that offer reasonable support for a
general claim and focuses on a single example
that argues against that claim
seeks to defend a view on the grounds that the

that view are often accepted as correct
rejects a claim as false on the grounds that those
who make that claim could proﬁt if that claim is
accepted by others
makes an unwarranted assumption that what is
true of each member of a group taken separately
is also true of the group as a whole
concludes that a particular premise is false when
it is equally possible for that premise to be true

implausible, superﬂuous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer, blacken the corresponding space
on your answer sheet.
1.

The painted spider spins webs that are much stickier
than the webs spun by the other species of spiders that
share the same habitat. Stickier webs are more efﬁcient
at trapping insects that ﬂy into them. Spiders prey
on insects by trapping them in their webs; therefore,
it can be concluded that the painted spider is a more
successful predator than its competitors.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Not all of the species of insects living in the
painted spider’s habitat are ﬂying insects.
Butterﬂies and moths, which can shed scales, are
especially unlikely to be trapped by spider webs
that are not very sticky.
Although the painted spider’s venom does not
kill insects quickly, it paralyzes them almost
instantaneously.
Stickier webs reﬂect more light, and so are more
visible to insects, than are less-sticky webs.
The webs spun by the painted spider are no
larger than the webs spun by the other species
of spiders in the same habitat.

Despite the best efforts of astronomers, no one has yet
succeeded in exchanging messages with intelligent

The argument’s reasoning is ﬂawed because the
argument
(A)

Bart: A mathematical problem that deﬁed solution
for hundreds of years has ﬁnally yielded to
a supercomputer. The process by which the
supercomputer derived the result is so complex,
however, that no one can fully comprehend it.
Consequently, the result is unacceptable.
Anne: In scientiﬁc research, if the results of a test can
be replicated in other tests, the results are acceptable
even though the way they were derived might not be
fully understood. Therefore, if a mathematical result
derived by a supercomputer can be reproduced by
other supercomputers following the same procedure, it
is acceptable.
3.

It is commonly held among marketing experts that in
a nonexpanding market a company’s best strategy is to
go after a bigger share of the market and that the best
way to do this is to run comparative advertisements that
emphasize weaknesses in the products of rivals. In the
stagnant market for food oil, soybean-oil and palm-oil
producers did wage a two-year battle with comparative
advertisements about the deleterious effect on health of
each other’s products. These campaigns, however, had
little effect on respective market shares; rather, they
stopped many people from buying any edible oils at all.
The statements above most strongly support the
conclusion that comparative advertisements

Bart’s argument requires which one of the following
assumptions?

(B)

(A)

(C)

(B)

The mathematical result in question is
unacceptable because it was derived with the
use of a supercomputer.
For the mathematical result in question to be
acceptable, there must be someone who can
fully comprehend the process by which it was
derived.
To be acceptable, the mathematical result
in question must be reproduced on another
supercomputer.
Making the mathematical result in question less
complex would guarantee its acceptability.
The supercomputer cannot derive an acceptable
solution to the mathematical problem in
question.

John:

In 80 percent of car accidents, the driver at fault
was within ﬁve miles of home, so people evidently

It shows that the evidence that John presents, by
itself, is not enough to prove his claim.
It restates the evidence that John presents in
different terms.
It gives additional evidence that is needed by
John to support his conclusion.
It calls into question John’s assumption that
whenever people drive more than ﬁve miles
from home they are going on a long trip.
It suggests that John’s conclusion is merely a

Theater critic: The theater is in a dismal state.
Audiences are sparse and revenue is down.
Without the audience and the revenue, the talented
and creative people who are the lifeblood of the
theater are abandoning it. No wonder standards

Producer: It’s not true that the theater is in decline.
Don’t you realize that your comments constitute
a self-fulﬁlling prophecy? By publishing these
opinions, you yourself are discouraging new
audiences from emerging and new talent from
joining the theater.
Which one of the following is a questionable technique
employed by the producer in responding to the critic?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

focusing on the effects of the critic’s evaluation
rather than on its content
accusing the critic of relying solely on opinion
unsupported by factual evidence

10. Michelangelo’s sixteenth-century Sistine Chapel
paintings are currently being restored. A goal of the
restorers is to uncover Michelangelo’s original work,
and so additions made to Michelangelo’s paintings by
later artists are being removed. However, the restorers
have decided to make one exception: to leave intact
additions that were painted by da Volterra.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
reconcile the restorers’ decision with the goal stated in
the passage?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

The restorers believe that da Volterra stripped
away all previous layers of paint before he
painted his own additions to the Sistine Chapel.
Because da Volterra used a type of pigment that
is especially sensitive to light, the additions to
the Sistine Chapel that da Volterra painted have
relatively muted colors.
Da Volterra’s additions were painted in a
style that was similar to the style used by
Michelangelo.
Michelangelo is famous primarily for his
sculptures and only secondarily for his
paintings, whereas da Volterra is known
exclusively for his paintings.
Da Volterra’s work is considered by certain art
historians to be just as valuable as the work of
some of the other artists who painted additions
to Michelangelo’s work.

11. A controversial program rewards prison inmates who
behave particularly well in prison by giving them
the chance to receive free cosmetic plastic surgery
performed by medical students. The program is
obviously morally questionable, both in its assumptions
about what inmates might want and in its use of the
prison population to train future surgeons. Putting these
moral issues aside, however, the surgery clearly has a
powerful rehabilitative effect, as is shown by the fact
that, among recipients of the surgery, the proportion
who are convicted of new crimes committed after
release is only half that for the prison population as a
whole.
A ﬂaw in the reasoning of the passage is that it
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

allows moral issues to be a consideration in
presenting evidence about matters of fact
dismisses moral considerations on the grounds
that only matters of fact are relevant
labels the program as “controversial” instead
of discussing the issues that give rise to
controversy
asserts that the rehabilitation of criminals is not a
moral issue

12. The retina scanner, a machine that scans the web of tiny
blood vessels in the retina, stores information about the
pattern formed by the blood vessels. This information
allows it to recognize any pattern it has previously
scanned. No two eyes have identical patterns of blood
vessels in the retina. A retina scanner can therefore be
used successfully to determine for any person whether
it has ever scanned a retina of that person before.
The reasoning in the argument depends upon assuming
that
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

diseases of the human eye do not alter the
pattern of blood vessels in the retina in ways
that would make the pattern unrecognizable to
the retina scanner
no person has a different pattern of blood vessels
in the retina of the left eye than in the retina of
the right eye
there are enough retina scanners to store
information about every person’s retinas
the number of blood vessels in the human retina
is invariant, although the patterns they form
differ from person to person
there is no person whose retinas have been
scanned by two or more different retina
scanners

13. There are just two ways a moon could have been
formed from the planet around which it travels: either
part of the planet’s outer shell spun off into orbit
around the planet or else a large object, such as a
comet or meteoroid, struck the planet so violently that
it dislodged a mass of material from inside the planet.
Earth’s moon consists primarily of materials different
from those of the Earth’s outer shell.
If the statements above are true, which one of the
following, if also true, would most help to justify
drawing the conclusion that Earth’s moon was not
formed from a piece of the Earth?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The moons of some planets in Earth’s solar
system were not formed primarily from the
planets’ outer shells.
Earth’s moon consists primarily of elements that
differ from those inside the Earth.
Earth’s gravity cannot have trapped a meteoroid
and pulled it into its orbit as the Moon.
The craters on the surface of Earth’s moon show
that it has been struck by many thousands of
large meteoroids.
Comets and large meteoroids normally move at
very high speeds.

14. Caffeine can kill or inhibit the growth of the larvae
of several species of insects. One recent experiment
showed that tobacco hornworm larvae die when they
ingest a preparation that consists, in part, of ﬁnely
powdered tea leaves, which contain caffeine. This
result is evidence for the hypothesis that the presence
of non-negligible quantities of caffeine in various parts
of many diverse species of plants is not accidental but
evolved as a defense for those plants.
The argument assumes that
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

caffeine-producing plants are an important raw
material in the manufacture of commercial
insecticides
caffeine is stored in leaves and other parts of
caffeine-producing plants in concentrations
roughly equal to the caffeine concentration of
the preparation fed to the tobacco hornworm
larvae
caffeine-producing plants grow wherever insect
larvae pose a major threat to indigenous plants
or once posed a major threat to the ancestors of
those plants
the tobacco plant is among the plant species that
produce caffeine for their own defense
caffeine-producing plants or their ancestors have
at some time been subject to being fed upon by
creatures sensitive to caffeine

15. The only plants in the garden were tulips, but they were
tall tulips. So the only plants in the garden were tall

Which one of the following exhibits faulty reasoning
most similar to the faulty reasoning in the argument
above?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

The only dogs in the show were poodles, and
they were all black poodles. So all the dogs in
the show were black.
All the buildings on the block were tall. The only
buildings on the block were ofﬁce buildings and
residential towers. So all the ofﬁce buildings on
the block were tall buildings.
All the primates in the zoo were gorillas. The
only gorillas in the zoo were small gorillas.
Thus the only primates in the zoo were small
primates.
The only fruit in the kitchen was pears, but the
pears were not ripe. Thus none of the fruit in the
kitchen was ripe.
All the grand pianos here are large. All the grand

16. Scientiﬁc research will be properly channeled whenever
those who decide which research to fund give due
weight to the scientiﬁc merits of all proposed research.
But when government agencies control these funding
decisions, political considerations play a major role
in determining which research will be funded, and
whenever political considerations play such a role,
the inevitable result is that scientiﬁc research is not
properly channeled.
Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the statements above?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

There is no proper role for political
considerations to play in determining who will
decide which scientiﬁc research to fund.
It is inevitable that considerations of scientiﬁc
merit will be neglected in decisions regarding
the funding of scientiﬁc research.
Giving political considerations a major role in
determining which scientiﬁc research to fund is
incompatible with giving proper weight to the
scientiﬁc merits of proposed research.
When scientiﬁc research is not properly
channeled, governments tend to step in and
take control of the process of choosing which
research to fund.
If a government does not control investment in
basic scientiﬁc research, political consideration
will inevitably be neglected in deciding which
research to fund.

17. A new silencing device for domestic appliances
operates by producing sound waves that cancel out the
sound waves produced by the appliance. The device,
unlike conventional silencers, actively eliminates the
noise the appliance makes, and for that reason vacuum
cleaners designed to incorporate the new device will
operate with much lower electricity consumption than
conventional vacuum cleaners.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain why the new silencing device will make lower
electricity consumption possible?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Designers of vacuum cleaner motors typically
have to compromise the motors’ efﬁciency in
order to reduce noise production.
The device runs on electricity drawn from the
appliance’s main power supply.
Conventional vacuum cleaners often use
spinning brushes to loosen dirt in addition to
using suction to remove dirt.
Governmental standards for such domestic
appliances as vacuum cleaners allow higher
electricity consumption when vacuum cleaners
are quieter.
The need to incorporate silencers in conventional
vacuum cleaners makes them heavier and less
mobile than they might otherwise be.

18. Because dinosaurs were reptiles, scientists once
assumed that, like all reptiles alive today, dinosaurs
were cold-blooded. The recent discovery of dinosaur
fossils in the northern arctic, however, has led a number
of researchers to conclude that at least some dinosaurs
might have been warm-blooded. These researchers
point out that only warm-blooded animals could have
withstood the frigid temperatures that are characteristic
of arctic winters, whereas cold-blooded animals would
have frozen to death in the extreme cold.
Which one of the following, if true, weakens the
researchers’ argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Today’s reptiles are generally conﬁned to regions
of temperate or even tropical climates.
The fossils show the arctic dinosaurs to have
been substantially smaller than other known
species of dinosaurs.
The arctic dinosaur fossils were found alongside
fossils of plants known for their ability to
withstand extremely cold temperatures.
The number of fossils found together indicates
herds of dinosaurs so large that they would need
to migrate to ﬁnd a continual food supply.

Questions 19-20
Maria: Calling any state totalitarian is misleading: it
implies total state control of all aspects of life. The real
world contains no political entity exercising literally
total control over even one such aspect. This is because
any system of control is inefﬁcient, and, therefore, its
degree of control is partial.
James: A one-party state that has tried to exercise control
over most aspects of a society and that has, broadly
speaking, managed to do so is totalitarian. Such a
system’s practical inefﬁciencies do not limit the
aptness of the term, which does not describe a state’s
actual degree of control as much as it describes the
nature of a state’s ambitions.
19. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
Maria’s main conclusion?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

No state can be called totalitarian without
inviting a mistaken belief.
To be totalitarian, a state must totally control
society.
The degree of control exercised by a state is
necessarily partial.
No existing state currently has even one aspect of
society under total control.
Systems of control are inevitably inefﬁcient.

20. James responds to Maria’s argument by
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

pointing out a logical inconsistency between
two statements she makes in support of her
argument
offering an alternative explanation for political
conditions she mentions
rejecting some of the evidence she presents
without challenging what she infers from it
disputing the conditions under which a key term
of her argument can be appropriately applied
demonstrating that her own premises lead to a
conclusion different from hers

21. The similarity between ichthyosaurs and ﬁsh is an
example of convergence, a process by which different
classes of organisms adapt to the same environment by
independently developing one or more similar external
body features. Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles and
thus do not belong to the same class of organisms as
ﬁsh. However, ichthyosaurs adapted to their marine
environment by converging on external body features
similar to those of ﬁsh. Most strikingly, ichthyosaurs,
like ﬁsh, had ﬁns.
If the statements above are true, which one of the
following is an inference that can be properly drawn on
the basis of them?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The members of a single class of organisms that
inhabit the same environment must be identical
in all their external body features.
The members of a single class of organisms
must exhibit one or more similar external body
features that differentiate that class from all
other classes of organisms.
It is only as a result of adaptation to similar
environments that one class of organisms
develops external body features similar to those
of another class of organisms.
An organism does not necessarily belong to a
class simply because the organism has one or
more external body features similar to those of
members of that class.
Whenever two classes of organisms share the
same environment, members of one class
will differ from members of the other class in
several external body features.

22. Further evidence bearing on Jamison’s activities
must have come to light. On the basis of previously
available evidence alone, it would have been impossible
to prove that Jamison was a party to the fraud, and
Jamison’s active involvement in the fraud has now been
deﬁnitively established.
The pattern of reasoning exhibited in the argument
above most closely parallels that exhibited in which one
of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Smith must not have purchased his house within
the last year. He is listed as the owner of that
house on the old list of property owners, and
anyone on the old list could not have purchased
his or her property within the last year.
Turner must not have taken her usual train to
Nantes today. Had she done so, she could not
have been in Nantes until this afternoon, but she
was seen having coffee in Nantes at 11 o’clock
this morning.
Norris must have lied when she said that she had
not authorized the investigation. There is no
doubt that she did authorize it, and authorizing
an investigation is not something anyone is
likely to have forgotten.
Waugh must have known that last night’s class
was canceled. Waugh was in the library
yesterday, and it would have been impossible
for anyone in the library not to have seen the
cancellation notices.
LaForte must have deeply resented being passed
over for promotion. He maintains otherwise,
but only someone who felt badly treated would
have made the kind of remark LaForte made at
yesterday’s meeting.

23. Reporting on a civil war, a journalist encountered
evidence that refugees were starving because the
government would not permit food shipments to
a rebel-held area. Government censors deleted all
mention of the government’s role in the starvation from
the journalist’s report, which had not implicated either
nature or the rebels in the starvation. The journalist
concluded that it was ethically permissible to ﬁle
the censored report, because the journalist’s news
agency would precede it with the notice “Cleared by
government censors.”
Which one of the following ethical criteria, if valid,
would serve to support the journalist’s conclusion while
placing the least constraint on the ﬂow of reported
information?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is ethical in general to report known facts but
unethical to do so while omitting other known
facts if the omitted facts would substantially
alter an impression of a person or institution
that would be congruent with the reported facts.
In a situation of conﬂict, it is ethical to report
known facts and unethical to fail to report
known facts that would tend to exonerate one
party to the conﬂict.
In a situation of censorship, it is unethical to
make any report if the government represented
by the censor deletes from the report material
unfavorable to that government.
It is ethical in general to report known facts
but unethical to make a report in a situation of
censorship if relevant facts have been deleted by
the censor, unless the recipient of the report is
warned that censorship existed.
Although it is ethical in general to report known
facts, it is unethical to make a report from
which a censor has deleted relevant facts, unless
the recipient of the report is warned that there
was censorship and the reported facts do not by
themselves give a misleading impression.

24. A birth is more likely to be difﬁcult when the mother is
over the age of 40 than when she is younger. Regardless
of the mother’s age, a person whose birth was difﬁcult
is more likely to be ambidextrous than is a person
whose birth was not difﬁcult. Since other causes of
ambidexterity are not related to the mother’s age, there
must be more ambidextrous people who were born to
women over 40 than there are ambidextrous people who
were born to younger women.
The argument is most vulnerable to which one of
the following criticisms?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It assumes what it sets out to establish.
It overlooks the possibility that fewer children
are born to women over 40 than to women
under 40.
It fails to specify what percentage of people in
the population as a whole are ambidextrous.
It does not state how old a child must be before
its handedness can be determined.
It neglects to explain how difﬁculties during birth
can result in a child’s ambidexterity.

Questions 25-26
The government has no right to tax earnings from labor.
Taxation of this kind requires the laborer to devote a certain
percentage of hours worked to earning money for the
government. Thus, such taxation forces the laborer to
work, in part, for another’s purpose. Since involuntary
servitude can be deﬁned as forced work for another’s
purpose, just as involuntary servitude is pernicious, so is
taxing earnings from labor.
25. The argument uses which one of the following
argumentative techniques?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

deriving a general principle about the rights of
individuals from a judgment concerning the
obligations of governments
inferring what will be the case merely from a
description of what once was the case
inferring that since two institutions are similar in
one respect, they are similar in another respect
citing the authority of an economic theory in
order to justify a moral principle
presupposing the inevitability of a hierarchical
class system in order to oppose a given
economic practice

26. Which one of the following is an error of reasoning
committed by the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It ignores a difference in how the idea of forced
work for another’s purpose applies to the two
cases.
It does not take into account the fact that labor is
taxed at different rates depending on income.
It mistakenly assumes that all work is taxed.
It ignores the fact that the government also taxes
income from investment.
It treats deﬁnitions as if they were matters of
subjective opinion rather than objective facts
about language.

Three kinds of study have been performed on
Byron. There is the biographical study—the very
valuable examination of Byron’s psychology and the
events in his life; Escarpit’s 1958 work is an example
of this kind of study, and biographers to this day
continue to speculate about Byron’s life. Equally
valuable is the study of Byron as a ﬁgure important
in the history of ideas; Russell and Praz have
written studies of this kind. Finally, there are
studies that primarily consider Byron’s poetry. Such
literary studies are valuable, however, only when
they avoid concentrating solely on analyzing the
verbal shadings of Byron’s poetry to the exclusion of
any discussion of biographical considerations. A
study with such a concentration would be of
questionable value because Byron’s poetry, for the
most part, is simply not a poetry of subtle verbal
meanings. Rather, on the whole, Byron’s poems
record the emotional pressure of certain moments
in his life. I believe we cannot often read a poem of
Byron’s, as we often can one of Shakespeare’s,
without wondering what events or circumstances in
his life prompted him to write it.
No doubt the fact that most of Byron’s poems
cannot be convincingly read as subtle verbal
creations indicates that Byron is not a “great” poet.
It must be admitted too that Byron’s literary
craftsmanship is irregular and often his
temperament disrupts even his lax literary method
(although the result, an absence of method, has a
signiﬁcant purpose: it functions as a rebuke to a
cosmos that Byron feels he cannot understand). If
Byron is not a “great” poet, his poetry is
nonetheless of extraordinary interest to us because
of the pleasure it gives us. Our main pleasure in
reading Byron’s poetry is the contact with a singular
personality. Reading his work gives us
illumination—self-understanding—after we have
seen our weaknesses and aspirations mirrored in
the personality we usually ﬁnd in the poems.
Anyone who thinks that this kind of illumination is
not a genuine reason for reading a poet should
think carefully about why we read Donne’s sonnets.
It is Byron and Byron’s idea of himself that hold
his work together (and that enthralled earlynineteenth-century Europe). Different characters
speak in his poems, but ﬁnally it is usually he
himself who is speaking: a far cry from the
impersonal poet Keats. Byron’s poetry alludes to

(50)

(55)
1.

Greek and Roman myth in the context of
contemporary affairs, but his work remains
generally of a piece because of his close presence in
the poetry. In sum, the poetry is a shrewd personal
performance, and to shut out Byron the
man is to fabricate a work of pseudocriticism.

The United States Supreme Court has not
always resolved legal issues of concern to Native
Americans in a manner that has pleased the Indian
nations. Many of the Court’s decisions have been
products of political compromise that looked more
to the temper of the times than to enduring principles
of law. But accommodation is part of the judicial
system in the United States, and judicial decisions
must be assessed with this fact in mind.
Despite the “accommodating” nature of the
judicial system, it is worth noting that the power of
the Supreme Court has been exercised in a manner
that has usually been beneﬁcial to Native
Americans, at least on minor issues, and has not
been wholly detrimental on the larger, more
important issues. Certainly there have been
decisions that cast doubt on the validity of this
assertion. Some critics point to the patronizing tone
of many Court opinions and the apparent rejection
of Native American values as important points to
consider when reviewing a case. However, the
validity of the assertion can be illustrated by
reference to two important contributions that have
resulted from the exercise of judicial power.
First, the Court has created rules of judicial
construction that, in general, favor the rights of
Native American litigants. The Court’s attitude has
been conditioned by recognition of the distinct
disadvantages Native Americans faced when
dealing with settlers in the past. Treaties were
inevitably written in English for the beneﬁt of their
authors, whereas tribal leaders were accustomed to
making treaties without any written account, on the
strength of mutual promises sealed by religious
commitment and individual integrity. The written
treaties were often broken, and Native Americans
were confronted with fraud and political and
military aggression. The Court recognizes that past
unfairness to Native Americans cannot be sanctioned
by the force of law. Therefore, ambiguities in treaties
are to be interpreted in favor of the Native American
claimants, treaties are to be interpreted as the Native
Americans would have understood them, and, under
the reserved rights doctrine, treaties reserve to Native
Americans all rights that have not been speciﬁcally
granted away in other treaties.
A second achievement of the judicial system is
the protection that has been provided against
encroachment by the states into tribal affairs.
Federal judges are not inclined to view favorably
efforts to extend states’ powers and jurisdictions
because of the direct threat that such expansion poses
to the exercise of federal powers. In the absence of a
federal statute directly and clearly allocating a function
to the states, federal judges are inclined to reserve for
the federal government—and the tribal governments
under its charge—all those powers and rights they can
be said to have possessed historically.

When catastrophe strikes, analysts typically
blame some combination of powerful mechanisms.
An earthquake is traced to an immense instability
along a fault line; a stock market crash is blamed on
the destabilizing effect of computer trading. These
explanations may well be correct. But systems as
large and complicated as the Earth’s crust or the
stock market can break down not only under the
force of a mighty blow but also at the drop of a pin.
In a large interactive system, a minor event can start
a chain reaction that leads to a catastrophe.
Traditionally, investigators have analyzed large
interactive systems in the same way they analyze
small orderly systems, mainly because the methods
developed for small systems have proved so
successful. They believed they could predict the
behavior of a large interactive system by studying its
elements separately and by analyzing its component
mechanisms individually. For lack of better
theory, they assumed that in large interactive systems
the response to a disturbance is proportional to that
disturbance.
During the past few decades, however, it has
become increasingly apparent that many large
complicated systems do not yield to traditional
analysis. Consequently, theorists have proposed a
“theory of self-organized criticality”: many large
interactive systems evolve naturally to a critical
state in which a minor event starts a chain reaction
that can affect any number of elements in the
system. Although such systems produce more minor
events than catastrophes, the mechanism that leads
to minor events is the same one that leads to major
events.
A deceptively simple system serves as a
paradigm for self-organized criticality: a pile of
sand. As sand is poured one grain at a time onto a
ﬂat disk, the grains at ﬁrst stay close to the position
where they land. Soon they rest on top of one
another, creating a pile that has a gentle slope. Now
and then, when the slope becomes too steep, the
grains slide down, causing a small avalanche. The
system reaches its critical state when the amount of
sand added is balanced, on average, by the amount
falling off the edge of the disk.
Now when a grain of sand is added, it can start
an avalanche of any size, including a “catastrophic”
event. Most of the time the grain will fall so that no
avalanche occurs. By studying a speciﬁc area of the
pile, one can even predict whether avalanches will
occur there in the near future. To such a local
observer, however, large avalanches would remain
unpredictable because they are a consequence of
the total history of the entire pile. No matter what
the local dynamics are, catastrophic avalanches
would persist at a relative frequency that cannot be
altered. Criticality is a global property of the sandpile.

Historians have long accepted the notion that
women of English descent who lived in the English
colonies of North America during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries were better off than either
the contemporary women in England or the
colonists’ own nineteenth-century daughters and
granddaughters. The “golden age” theory
originated in the 1920s with the work of Elizabeth
Dexter, who argued that there were relatively few
women among the colonists, and that all
hands—male and female—were needed to sustain
the growing settlements. Rigid sex-role distinctions
could not exist under such circumstances; female
colonists could accordingly engage in whatever
occupations they wished, encountering few legal or
social constraints if they sought employment outside
the home. The surplus of male colonists also gave
women crucial bargaining power in the marriage
market, since women’s contributions were vital to
the survival of colonial households.
Dexter’s portrait of female colonists living under
conditions of rough equality with their male
counterparts was eventually incorporated into
studies of nineteenth-century middle-class women.
The contrast between the self-sufﬁcient colonial
woman and the oppressed nineteenth-century
woman, conﬁned to her home by stultifying
ideologies of domesticity and by the fact that
industrialization eliminated employment
opportunities for middle-class women, gained an
extraordinarily tenacious hold on historians. Even
scholars who have questioned the “golden age”
view of colonial women’s status have continued to
accept the paradigm of a nineteenth-century
decline from a more desirable past. For example,
Joan Hoff-Wilson asserted that there was no “golden
age” and yet emphasized that the nineteenth century
brought “increased loss of function and authentic
status for” middle-class women.
Recent publications about colonial women have
exposed the concept of a decline in status as
simplistic and unsophisticated, a theory that based
its assessment of colonial women’s status solely on
one factor (their economic function in society) and
assumed all too readily that a relatively simple
social system automatically brought higher standing
to colonial women. The new scholarship presents a
far more complicated picture, one in which
deﬁnitions of gender roles, the colonial economy,
demographic patterns, religion, the law, and
household organization all contributed to deﬁning
the circumstances of colonial women’s lives. Indeed,
the primary concern of modern scholarship is not to
generalize about women’s status but to identify the
speciﬁc changes and continuities in women’s lives
during the colonial period. For example, whereas
earlier historians suggested that there was little
change for colonial women before 1800, the new

scholarship suggests that a three-part chronological
division more accurately reﬂects colonial women’s
experiences. First was the initial period of English
colonization (from the 1620s to about 1660); then a
period during which patterns of family and
community were challenged and reshaped (roughly
from 1660 to 1750); and ﬁnally the era of revolution
(approximately 1750 to 1815), which brought other
chances to women’s lives.

22. Which one of the following best expresses the main
idea of the passage?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

An earlier theory about the status of middle-class
women in the nineteenth century has been

nineteenth-century women have altered an
earlier theory about the status of colonial
women.
Recent scholarship has exposed an earlier theory
about the status of colonial women as too
narrowly based and oversimpliﬁed.
An earlier theory about colonial women
has greatly inﬂuenced recent studies on
middle-class women in the nineteenth century.
An earlier study of middle-class women was
based on insufﬁcient research on the status of
women in the nineteenth century.

23. The author discusses Hoff-Wilson primarily in order to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

describe how Dexter’s theory was refuted by
historians of nineteenth-century North America
describe how the theory of middle-class women’s
nineteenth-century decline in status was
developed
describe an important inﬂuence on recent
scholarship about the colonial period
demonstrate the persistent inﬂuence of the
“golden age” theory
provide an example of current research on the
colonial period

25. It can be inferred from the passage that, in proposing
the “three-part chronological division” (lines 60-61),
scholars recognized which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The circumstances of colonial women’s lives
were deﬁned by a broad variety of social and
economic factors.
Women’s lives in the English colonies of North
America were similar to women’s lives in
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England.
Colonial women’s status was adversely affected
when patterns of family and community were
established in the late seventeenth century.
Colonial women’s status should be assessed
primarily on the basis of their economic
function in society.
Colonial women’s status was low when the
colonies were settled but changed signiﬁcantly
during the era of revolution.

27. Practitioners of the new scholarship discussed in the last
paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one
of the following statements about Dexter’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

It makes the assumption that women’s status is
determined primarily by their political power in
society.
It makes the assumption that a less complex
social system necessarily confers higher status
on women.
It is based on inadequate research on women’s
economic role in the colonies.
It places too much emphasis on the way
deﬁnitions of gender roles affected women
colonists in the colonial period.
It accurately describes the way women’s status
declined in the nineteenth century.

26. According to the author, the publications about colonial
women mentioned in the third paragraph had which one
of the following effects?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

They undermined Dexter’s argument on the
status of women colonists during the colonial
period.
They revealed the tenacity of the “golden age”
theory in American history.
They provided support for historians, such as
Hoff-Wilson, who study the nineteenth century.
They established that women’s status did not
change signiﬁcantly from the colonial period to
the nineteenth century.
They provided support for earlier theories about
women colonists in the English colonies of
North America.
