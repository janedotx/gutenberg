The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes
from a region half in Mexico and half in the United
States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border.
Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late
1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that
has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish,
corridos combine formal features of several different
types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently
deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
For example, “El Corrido de Kiansis” (c. 1870), the
oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the
first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single
important event is likely to have inspired several
corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given
story all partake of standard generic elements. When
sung at social gatherings, corridos served to
commemorate significant local happenings, but more
importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic
and thematic conventions served to affirm the
cohesiveness of Border communities.
Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb
correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their
stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments.
Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare
in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually
incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the
songs’ listeners. In the popular “El Corrido de
Gregorio Cortez,” for example, the hero Cortez,
fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a
thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights
than the one they gave him: “I have weathered
thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn’t bother me.”
Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos
including “Kiansis,” which tells of stampedes caused
by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such
imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable
to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the
continuity of the corrido tradition.
The corrido is composed not only of familiar
images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel
easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident
in the corrido’s formal closing verse, or despedida.
The despedida of one variant of “Gregorio Cortez” is
translated as follows: “Now with this I say farewell /
In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the
ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez.” The first and third
lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines
are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the
corrido or expressing its subject, and the second

(50)

varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the
despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the
corrido’s uniqueness and its generic continuity, the
corrido’s maker asserts that the task of relating an
authentic Border tale has been accomplished.

the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(A)
(B)
(C)

6. The passage provides the most support for inferring
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

“El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez” was rarely
sung at Border social gatherings.
Most surviving corridos do not exist in
complete form.
All complete corridos have some lines in
common.
Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
“El Corrido de Kiansis” was composed by
someone not from the Border region.

7. The passage most strongly suggests that the author
would agree with which one of the following
statements?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

In at least some cases, the dependence of
corridos on ready-made lines hindered the
efforts of corrido makers to use metaphor
effectively.
The corrido is unique among ballad forms
because it uses language that is familiar mainly
to local audiences.
Much of the imagery used in corridos can also
be identified in ballads from Spain.
The reportorial capability of corridos was
probably enhanced by their freedom from the
constraints of rhymed ballad forms.
A corrido without a surviving despedida would
probably still be identifiable as a corrido.

The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to
insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical
composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two
categories of chemical substances: primary and
secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins,
carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required
for growth and proper functioning and are found in all
plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and
multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known
role in the internal chemical processes of plants’
growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances
occur in any one species of plant, but the same or
similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the
various species that constitute a single family. It is
these secondary substances that give plants their
distinctive tastes and smells.
Insects appear to have played a major role in
many plants’ having the secondary substances they
have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared,
and new ones continue to appear, as the result of
genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation
is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations,
it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it
must increase the likelihood of the organism’s
surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances
are favored by natural selection because they are
scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such
scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes
the insects without damage to the plants. Other
secondary substances that arose by mutation were
conserved by natural selection because they proved to
be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants,
the majority of which are insects. Some of these
defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant
symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary
substances are not in themselves harmful to insects,
but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the
insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of
some other substance that is harmful.
For hundreds of millions of years there has been
an evolutionary competition for advantage between
plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive
as the plants they eat develop defenses against them,
they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to
circumvent the plants’ defenses. They may evolve a
way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their
bodies out of harm’s way, or to avoid its effects in
some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the
plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they
eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their
characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the
competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants
have remained as suitable food sources for any one
species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to
become associated with narrowly defined and often
botanically restricted groups of plants.

8. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Although the secondary substances in plants do
not take part in the plants’ basic biological
processes, these substances operate as natural
defenses against damage and destruction by
insects.
Long-term competition between plants and
insects has led to a narrowing of the range of
secondary substances present in plants and,
thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect
species that eat each species of plant.
The particular secondary substances possessed
by different plants, and thus the distinctive
tastes and smells that present-day plants have,
result in large part from an evolutionary process
of interaction between plants and insects.
Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted
by insects, the secondary substances in plants
have become numerous and diverse but tend to
be similar among closely related species.
Because plant mutations have led to the
development of secondary substances, plants
have come to participate in a continuing process
of competition with plant-eating insects.

9. Which one of the following is mentioned in the passage
as a way in which insects can adapt when a plant
develops defenses against them?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

to start eating something else instead
to avoid plants with certain distinctive leaf or
flower structures
to increase their rate of reproduction
to pollinate other species of plants
to avoid contact with the dangerous parts of
the plant

10. In the passage, the author discusses primary substances
mainly in order to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

provide information about how plants grow and
metabolize nutrients
help explain what secondary substances are
help distinguish between two ways that insects
have affected plant evolution

occur in various species of plants
provide evidence of plants’ adaptation to insects

11. The passage provides the most support for inferring
which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Some chemicals that are not known to be
directly involved in the growth or metabolism
of any species of plant play vital roles in the
lives of various kinds of plants.
Most plants that have evolved chemical defense
systems against certain insect species are
nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of
insects that have evolved ways of circumventing
those defenses.
Most insects that feed exclusively on certain
botanically restricted groups of plants are able
to identify these plants by means other than
their characteristic taste or smell.
Many secondary substances that are toxic to
insects are thought by scientists to have
evolved independently in various unrelated
species of plants but to have survived in only
a few species.
Some toxic substances that are produced by
plants evolved in correlation with secondary
substances but are not themselves secondary
substances.

12. Which one of the following describes a set of
relationships that is most closely analogous to the
relationships between plants and their primary and
secondary substances?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Electrical power for the operation of devices
such as lights and medical instruments is
essential to the proper functioning of hospitals;
generators are often used in hospitals to
provide electricity in case their usual source of
power is temporarily unavailable.
Mechanical components such as engines and
transmissions are necessary for automobiles to
run; features such as paint and taillights give a
car its distinctive look and serve functions
such as preventing rust and improving safety,
but automobiles can run without them.
Mechanical components such as gears and
rotors are required for the operation of clothing
factories; electrical components such as wires
and transformers supply the power needed to
run the mechanical components, but they do
not participate directly in the manufacturing
process.
Some type of braking system is necessary for
trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such
systems comprise both friction components that
directly contact the trains’ wheels and
pneumatic components that exert pressure on
the friction components.
Specially designed word processing programs
are necessary for computers to be able to
function as word processors; such programs
can be stored either in the computers’ internal
memory system or on external disks that are
inserted temporarily into the computers.

-1313. The passage most strongly suggests that which one of
the following is true of secondary substances in plants?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Some of them are the results of recent natural
mutations in plants.
They typically contribute to a plant’s taste or
smell, but not both.
Some of them undergo chemical reactions with
substances produced by insects, thus altering
the plants’ chemical composition.
Some species of plants produce only one such
substance.
A few of them act as regulators of plants’
production of primary substances.

14. Based on the passage, the author would be most likely
to agree with which one of the following statements
about the relationship between plants and insects?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The diversity of secondary substances that
develop in a plant population is proportional to
the number of insects with which that plant
population has interacted throughout its
evolutionary history.
Although few species of plants have benefited
from evolutionary interaction with insects,
many species of insects use plants without
either harming the plants or increasing the
plants’ chances of survival.
Throughout the process of evolutionary change,
the number of plant species within each family
has generally increased while the number of
families of plants has decreased.
No particular secondary substance has appeared
in plants in direct response to insects, though
in many instances insects have influenced
which particular secondary substances are
present in a plant species.
While many species of insects have evolved
ways of circumventing plants’ chemical
defenses, none has done this through outright
immunity to plants’ secondary substances.

David Warsh’s book describes a great
contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776,
when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations.
Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory
and the Invisible Hand.
Using the example of a pin factory, Smith
emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could
be achieved through increased size. The pin factory’s
employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce
far more than they could if each worked independently.
Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market
economy can harness self-interest to the common
good, leading each individual as though “by an
invisible hand to promote an end which was no part
of his intention.” For example, businesses sell products
that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the
business owners inherently want to please people but
because doing so enables them to make money in a
competitive marketplace.
These two concepts, however, are opposed to
each other. The parable of the pin factory says that
there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the
pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be,
and therefore the more pins the factory can produce
per worker. But increasing returns create a natural
tendency toward monopoly, because a large business
can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a
small business. So given increasing returns, bigger
firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until
each industry is dominated by just a few players. But
for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be
many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can
exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free
markets always get it right depends on the assumption
that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
For almost two centuries, the assumption of
diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with
the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh
explains, it wasn’t about ideology; it was about
following the line of least mathematical resistance.
Economics has always had scientific aspirations;
economists have always sought the rigor and clarity
that comes from representing their ideas using numbers
and equations. And the economics of diminishing
returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism,
while those of increasing returns—the Pin Factory—
are notoriously hard to represent mathematically.
Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the
Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought
to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously
characterized many enterprises, such as railroads.
Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state
their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late
1970s has this “underground river”—a term used to
describe the role of increasing returns in economic
thought—surfaced into the mainstream of economic
thought. By then, economists had finally found ways
to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to
make it respectable.

15. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Mainstream economists have always assumed
that returns to scale are generally increasing
rather than decreasing.
The functioning of the Invisible Hand is
accepted primarily because diminishing returns
can be described with mathematical rigor.
Recent developments in mathematics have
enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even
more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
Adam Smith was the first economist to
understand how a market economy can enable
individual self-interest to serve the common
good.
Economists have, until somewhat recently,
failed to account for the increasing returns to
scale common in many industries.

16. The author’s attitude towards the idea that the Pin
Factory model should be part of the mainstream of
economic thought could most accurately be described
as one of
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

hostility
uncertainty
curiosity
indifference
receptivity

17. The main purpose of the fourth paragraph is to
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

critique a theory purporting to resolve the
tensions between two economic assumptions
explain a difficulty associated with modeling a
particular economic assumption
outline the intuitions supporting a particular
economic assumption
describe the tensions resulting from attempts to
model two competing economic assumptions

economic assumption

model would continue to be an “underground river”
(line 54) were it not for
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the fact that economics has always been a
discipline with scientific aspirations
David Warsh’s analysis of the work of Adam

20. Which one of the following best illustrates the concept
of increasing returns to scale described in the second
paragraph of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A publishing house is able to greatly improve
the productivity of its editors by relaxing the
standards to which those editors must adhere.
This allows the publishing house to employ
many fewer editors.
A large bee colony is able to use some bees
solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables
the colony to collect more nectar, which can
feed a larger colony that can better divide up
the work of processing the nectar.
A school district increases the total number of
students that can be accommodated in a single
building by switching to year-round operation,
with a different quarter of its student body on
vacation at any given time.
The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch
substantially more lobsters a day with the same
number of traps because advances in technology
make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters
to get through.
A large ant colony divides and produces two
competing colonies that each eventually grow
large and prosperous enough to divide into
more colonies. These colonies together contain
more ants than could have existed in one colony.

21. The passage states which one of the following?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

The only way that increasing returns to scale
could occur is through increases in the
specialization of workers.
Economics fails in its quest to be scientific
because its models lack mathematical rigor.
The Pin Factory model’s long-standing failure
to gain prominence among economists was not
a problem of ideology.
Under the Pin Factory model no one is in a
position to exert monopoly power.
Adam Smith did not recognize any tension
between the Pin Factory model and the
Invisible Hand model.

22. Which one of the following, if true, would most
undermine the connection that the author draws between
increased size and monopoly power?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In some industries, there are businesses that
are able to exert monopoly power in one
geographical region even though there are
larger businesses in the same industry in
other regions.
As the tasks workers focus on become
narrower, the workers are not able to command
as high a salary as when they were performing
a greater variety of tasks.
When an industry is dominated by only a few
players, these businesses often collude in order
to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
The size that a business must reach in order to
begin to achieve increasing returns to scale
varies widely from industry to industry.
If a business has very specialized workers, any
gains in productivity achieved by making
workers even more specialized are offset by
other factors such as higher training costs and
increased turnover.

Passage A
Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify
particular laws, or particular applications of law,
simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power
appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here
to explain why.
Rules of law are almost always overinclusive:
read literally, they forbid some conduct that the
legislature that formulated the rule did not want to
forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the
conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive
given the limitations of human foresight and the
inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly
the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct,
the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an
overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very
heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing
an innocent person in order to reduce the probability
of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of
punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against
the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the
danger must be traded off against the costs of
alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a
technique—discretionary nonenforcement—by which
the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a
corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes).
Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement
does not determine the principle by which the law
enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably
the agency could concentrate its resources on those
areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently
within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely.
Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare)
but it does not appear to be the central tendency since
legislative oversight assures that the agency does not
stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the
enacted, regulation being enforced.
Passage B
The newspaper reported that 231,000 water
customers in the city are late paying their bills—some
by months, others by decades. In all, these water
delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in
overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to
selectively cut the water to a few residences with
outstanding bills to show that they are serious about
collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only
high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a
few privileged residents who will be in no position to
complain since they were caught stiffing the system.
But property owners are responsible for water
bills. So why not just do what every other propertyrelated creditor or tax authority does—attach a lien to
the property? The money owed would automatically
be available whenever a property was sold, and the
threat of negative credit implications would be a
powerful incentive to keep current with one’s water
obligations.
Well, here’s an answer: a loophole prohibits debts
other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city,

(60)

and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the
problem is with the law, then why not change the law?
Wouldn’t that be easier, and politically smarter, than
shutting off people’s water?

23. Both passages explicitly mention which one of the
following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

legal technicalities
incentives
loopholes
language
overinclusive laws

24. Which one of the following statements can be inferred
from the material in passage B?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most water customers in the city are late paying
their water bills.
Most of the residences with outstanding water
bills are in the city’s high-income
neighborhoods.
It is appropriate to turn off the water of
high-income residents in the city who pay their
water bills a few days late.
In recent years, the city has rarely, if ever,
turned off the water of customers who were
late paying their water bills.
The only reasonable solution to the problem of
overdue water bills in the city is to enact a law
that classifies water bills as taxes.

25. The role of the word “selectively” in passage B
(line 42) is most closely related to the role of which
one of the following words in passage A?

26. The author of passage A would be most likely to agree
with which one of the following statements concerning
the plan described in lines 41–47 in passage B?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Officials should not implement the plan until
just after the legislature’s annual appropriations
hearing.
At least the plan would have a lower social cost
than would turning off the water of all 231,000
households that have not paid on time.
The plan is a reasonable response to the water
department’s history of enforcing overinclusive
rules to the letter.
A better plan would have been to place liens on
the properties owned by those who are late
paying their bills.
Instead of implementing the plan, specific laws
regarding the payment of water bills should be
introduced to provide a more effective set of
incentives.

Research using laboratory mice that is aimed at
improving human health is compromised by
the conditions under which the mice are kept.
Those who conduct research aimed at
improving human health will develop new
research techniques.
Laboratory mice that are used for research that
is not directly related to human health are not
usually kept in small cages.

2. “Dumping” is defined as selling a product in another
country for less than production cost. Shrimp producers
from Country F are selling shrimp in Country G below
the cost of producing shrimp in Country G. So Country F’s
producers are dumping shrimp.
In order to evaluate the argument above, it is necessary
to determine whether
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

“production cost” in the definition of dumping
refers to the cost of producing the product in
the country where it originates or in the
country where it is sold
there is agreement among experts about whether
dumping is harmful to the economy of the
country in which products are sold for less
than production cost
shrimp producers from Country F charge more
for shrimp that they sell within their own country
than for shrimp that they sell in Country G
shrimp producers from Country F will
eventually go out of business if they continue
to sell shrimp in Country G for less than
production cost
shrimp producers from Country F are selling
shrimp in Country G for considerably less
than production cost or just slightly less

3. Scientist: Venus contains a hot molten core, like that of
Earth. Also like Earth, Venus must expel the
excess heat the core generates. On Earth, this
occurs entirely through active volcanos and
fissures created when tectonic plates separate.
Yet Venus has neither active volcanos nor fissures
caused by the movement of tectonic plates.
Which one of the following, if true, does the most to
resolve the apparent discrepancy described by the
scientist?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Rock on the surface of Venus remains solid
at much higher temperatures than does rock
on Earth.
The surface of Venus is relatively thin, allowing
internally produced heat to radiate into space.
The interior of Venus undergoes greater
fluctuations in temperature than does that
of Earth.
Though Venus lacks active volcanoes and
heat-diffusing fissures, it has surface
movement somewhat like that of Earth.
The atmosphere of Venus is significantly hotter
than that of Earth.

4. Columnist: The managers of some companies routinely
donate a certain percentage of their companies’
profits each year to charity. Although this practice
may seem totally justified and even admirable, it
is not. After all, corporate profits are not the
property of the managers, but of the companies’
owners. The legendary Robin Hood may have
stolen from the rich to give to the poor, but he
was nevertheless stealing.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
analogy used in the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The profits that a company makes in a given
year are, in part, returned to the owners of
the company.
Managers who routinely donate a certain
percentage of corporate profits to charity do
so with the owners’ tacit consent.
Company managers often donate part of their
own income to charities or other philanthropic
organizations.
Any charity that accepts corporate donations
needs to be able to account for how that
money is spent.
Charities often solicit contributions from
companies as well as private individuals.

5. Principle: A law whose purpose is to protect wild
animal populations should not be enforced
against those whose actions do not threaten wild
animal populations.
Application: Even though there is a law against
capturing wild snakes, which was enacted to
protect wild snake populations, snake charmers
who violate this law should not be prosecuted.

7. Several companies that make herbal teas containing
ginseng assert in their marketing that ginseng counteracts
the effects of stress. As a result, many people buy these
products hoping to improve their health. Yet no definitive
scientific study links ginseng with the relief of stress.
Thus, these marketing campaigns make false claims.
The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the
argument

Which one of the following, if true, most justifies the
above application of the principle?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Since there are relatively few snake charmers
and they each capture relatively few snakes
per year, snake charmers have a minimal
effect on wild populations.
Many attempts to prosecute snake charmers
under this law have failed because prosecutors
lacked adequate knowledge of the procedures
used to capture snakes.
Very few, if any, snake charmers are aware
that there is a law that prohibits the capture
of wild snakes.
Snake populations are much less threatened
than the populations of several other species
for which capture is legal.
Snake charmers capture wild snakes only
because they believe they would be unable
to earn a living otherwise.

6. A film makes a profit if the number of people who see
it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales
greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the
primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the
number of people who see a film. However, it is not
the primary goal of television executives to maximize
the number of viewers for their shows.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the difference between the goals of movie
executives and those of television executives?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

More people are willing to see a film more
than once than are willing to watch a
television show more than once.
There is no analog in television to the large
profits that owners of movie theaters make by
selling refreshments to their customers.
The average cost of producing an hour of film
is much greater than the average cost of
producing an hour of television.
Television shows make their profits from
sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the
purchasing power of the people who watch a
television show.
Over half of the most popular television
shows are shows that viewers do not have
to pay to watch.

8. Scientists conjecture that certain microbes consume
organic molecules in exposed shale and similar
sediments. In so doing, the microbes remove oxygen
from the atmosphere and generate carbon dioxide, a
gas that, evidence indicates, promotes global warming.
They also conjecture that these microbes reproduce
more quickly at higher temperatures.
The scientists’ conjectures, if true, provide the most
support for which one of the following statements?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The microbes’ activity will soon diminish as
the organic molecules in exposed sediments
are depleted.
Every organism that generates carbon dioxide
reproduces more quickly at high temperatures.
If global warming occurs, it will be exacerbated
by the activity of the microbes.
The microbes do not remove any element other
than oxygen from the atmosphere.
A significant portion of the carbon dioxide in
Earth’s atmosphere was produced by the
microbes.

9. A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier
than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if
everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the
marine species on which it is based would become
extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not
recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
The reasoning in which one of the following arguments
most closely resembles that in the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Some studies have provided evidence that
taking a vitamin E supplement every day
reduces one’s risk of heart attack. However,
it has not been conclusively established that
vitamin E supplements are safe for all people.
So we should not recommend that everyone
take vitamin E supplements every day.
Governments are within their rights to tax
tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue
on education. If these taxes become too high,
however, people might smoke less, thereby
reducing the funding thus generated for
education. So such taxes might eventually
have to be supplemented by other sources
of revenue.
A consumer is better off when limiting purchases
to what he or she truly needs and saving or
investing any remaining income. If everyone
did this, however, the economy would be
thrown into a severe recession, thereby making
saving and investing impossible for most
people. So we should not recommend this
spending pattern to everyone.
If legislators spent less time campaigning, they
would have more time to do the jobs for which
they were elected. But if they did not spend so
much time campaigning, they probably would
not get reelected. So it is not surprising that
legislators spend so much time campaigning.
If we restrict land development in wilderness
areas, we help preserve many of the species
that now inhabit these areas. But we also
thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly
smaller number of species, such as deer, that
flourish in developed areas. So it is not always
clear which areas should be designated as
wilderness areas.

10. People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to
certain proteins found in the animals’ skin secretions
and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible,
however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer.
Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their
environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable
of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common
for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some—
but not all—people who are allergic to cats.
Which one of the following statements is most strongly
supported by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Any particular individual will be allergic to
some breeds of cat but not to others.
No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction
in all types of allergy sufferers.
Not all cats are identical with respect to the
proteins contained in their skin secretions
and saliva.
The allergic reactions of some people who are
allergic to cats are more intense than the
allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
There is no way to predict whether a given cat
will produce an allergic reaction in a particular
allergy sufferer.

11. Cartographer: Maps are like language: they can be
manipulated in order to mislead. That most people
are not generally misled by words, however,
should not lead us to think that most people are
not susceptible to being misled by maps. Most
people are taught to be cautious interpreters of
language, but education in the sophisticated use
of maps is almost nonexistent.
Which one of the following most accurately describes
how the statement that most people are taught to be
cautious interpreters of language functions in the
cartographer’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

It is offered as an analogical case that helps to
clarify the meaning of the argument’s conclusion.
It is a conclusion drawn from the claim that
education in the sophisticated use of maps is
almost nonexistent.
It is part of a distinction drawn in order to
support the argument’s conclusion.

that maps have certain relevant similarities
to language.

12. Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has
dangerous side effects has recently been criticized
by a prominent physician. However, the physician
is employed by the company that manufactures
that drug, and hence probably has personal
reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate
grounds to reject the book’s claims about the
drug’s side effects.
The reasoning in the journalist’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following
grounds?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It fails to address adequately the possibility
that the critique of the book called into
question other claims made in the book in
addition to the claim that the drug has
dangerous side effects.
It takes for granted that anyone even remotely
associated with a company that manufactures
a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence
concerning possible dangerous side effects of
that drug.
It overlooks the possibility that the author of
the book was biased for personal reasons in
favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous
side effects.
It fails to address adequately the possibility
that someone who has personal reasons to
deny a claim may nonetheless provide
legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
It overlooks the possibility that even if a
critique does not provide legitimate grounds to
reject a claim, this failure need not be the
result of any personal biases of the author.

13. A computer game publisher has recently released its
latest adventure game. The game’s inventive puzzles
and compelling plot induce even casual players to
become preoccupied with completing it. The game can
be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day
intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost
of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the
game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase
price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations
and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher
predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed
expectations.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
justify the publisher’s prediction?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

The game can be purchased directly from the
publisher as well as from retailers.
It takes several weeks for most players to
complete the game.
The publisher’s games are among the most
popular computer games on the market.
Most people who complete the game do not
play it extensively afterward.
Some people buy and complete the game and
then give it away to a friend.

14. City dog licensing records show that more cocker
spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights
neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods

whether cocker spaniels are more likely than
dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners
whether there are more cocker spaniels

15. Psychologists recently conducted a study in which
people from widely disparate cultures were asked to
examine five photographs. Each photograph depicted the
face of a person expressing one of five basic human
emotions—fear, happiness, disgust, anger, and sadness.
The people in the study were asked to identify the
emotion being expressed in each photograph. For each
photograph, everyone identified the same emotion. This
shows that people are genetically predisposed to
associate certain facial expressions with certain basic
emotions.

17. Brianna: It would have been better to buy a tree last
summer rather than this summer. The one we
bought this summer is struggling to survive this
summer’s drought. If we had bought one last
summer, it would have been able to survive this
summer’s drought, because last summer’s normal
rainfall would have enabled it to develop established
roots. Trees with established roots can better
withstand droughts.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the overall conclusion drawn in Brianna’s argument?

Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

For each photograph, the emotion that the
subjects agreed was being expressed was the
emotion that the person photographed was, in
fact, feeling.
One’s emotional disposition is not influenced
by one’s culture.
Some behaviors that are present in people from
widely disparate cultures are nonetheless
culturally influenced.
If there is a behavior common to people of
widely disparate cultures, then there is probably
a genetic predisposition to that behavior.
The people whose faces were depicted in the
photographs were not all from the same culture.

16. Judge: The defendant admits noncompliance with
national building codes but asks that penalties
not be imposed because he was confused as to
whether national or local building codes applied
to the area in which he was building. This excuse
might be acceptable had he been charged with
noncompliance with local codes, but since he is
charged with noncompliance with national codes,
his excuse is unacceptable.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the judge’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Local codes and national codes must not
overlap with each other.
Local codes may be less strict, but not more
strict, than national codes.
Any behavior required by national codes is
also required by local codes.
Ignorance of the difference between two codes
is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
A behavior that is in compliance with one law
is not necessarily in compliance with another.

(C)

(D)
(E)

It would have been better to buy a tree last

If a tree had been purchased last summer, it

Trees with established roots can better

discipline is radically changed. Progress has been made

20. A study found that when rating the educational value of
specific children’s television shows parents tend to base
their judgments primarily on how much they themselves

educational value. Accordingly, if the psychologists’
views are sound, parents have little reason to trust their
own ratings of the educational value of children’s
television shows.

The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the
grounds that it

The current focus of research into artificial
intelligence will produce devices no more
capable of displaying true intelligence than a

If the current focus of research into artificial
intelligence is not radically changed, this
research will not be able to produce machines
capable of true intelligence.
Despite progress in creating machines of great

The capacity to express noncognitive responses
such as emotion is at least as important for true
intelligence as is computational sophistication.
If a machine is not capable of producing

paying $1 million. That Pellman settled instead of
going to trial indicates their corporate leaders

Simon: It’s unclear whether Pellman’s leaders expected
to lose in court. But I think they expected that,
whether they won or lost the case, the legal fees
involved in going to trial would have been more
costly than the settlement. So settling the lawsuit
seemed the most cost-effective solution.
The dialogue provides the most support for the claim
that Justine and Simon disagree with each other about
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If the lawsuit against Pellman had gone to trial,
it is likely that Pellman would have lost in court.
Pellman’s corporate leaders were able to
accurately estimate their chances of winning
in court.
If Pellman’s legal fees for going to trial would
have been more costly than the settlement,
then settling the lawsuit was the most

22. Astrologer: Although some scientists have claimed that
there is no correlation between people’s astrological

23. Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events

or blaming a person for that action—as we
sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy’s
rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events
leading up to any action, we would cease to
regard that action as freely performed.
Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the
conclusion of the ethicist’s argument to be properly drawn?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

People should not be regarded as subject to
praise or blame for actions that were caused
by conditions beyond their control.
Whether an act is one for which the person
doing it is genuinely responsible is not
determined by how much information others
possess about that act.
We can be justified in praising or blaming a
person for an action only when we regard that
action as freely performed.
The responsibility a person bears for an action
is not a matter of degree; however, our
inclination to blame or praise whoever
performed the action varies with the amount
of information available.
If we do not know much about the events
leading up to any given action, we will regard
that action as freely performed.

If a tire’s pressure is too low, the tire will wear

prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure

If a tire’s pressure is too low, the tire will wear
out prematurely. But tire pressure will become
too low only if the car owner neglects to check
the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out
prematurely if the car owner neglects to check
the pressure regularly.
Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect
to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car
owners are unaware of this fact, they check the
tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be
made aware of the consequences of neglecting
to check the tire pressure.
If a tire’s pressure is too low, the tire will wear
out prematurely. But tire pressure will become
too low if the car owner neglects to check the
pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner
neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire
will wear out prematurely.
If a tire’s pressure is too low, the tire will wear
out prematurely. But it will also wear out
prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads.
Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel
roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too
low will not help it to last longer.

1. Curator: Critics have rightly claimed that removing the
centuries-old grime from the frescoes of
Michelangelo will expose them to acids formed
by the combination of water vapor in human
breath with pollutants in the air. Notwithstanding
this fact, the restoration should continue, for the
frescoes in their present condition cannot be seen
as they appeared when painted by Michelangelo.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the curator’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The decision as to whether an artwork
merits restoration or not should depend
on its greatness as judged by aesthetic
standards alone.
An artwork possesses aesthetic value only if
there are people who observe and appreciate it.
It is acceptable to risk future damage to an
artwork if the purpose is to enable it to be
appreciated in its original form.
It is right to spend large amounts of money on
the restoration of an old artwork if this
restoration makes the artwork accessible to
large numbers of people.
A picture that has become encrusted with
grime over a long period can no longer be
regarded as the same work of art as that
painted by the artist.

2. Forest fragmentation occurs when development severs
a continuous area of forest, breaking it down into
small patches. Some animals, such as white-footed
mice, thrive in conditions of forest fragmentation,
reaching their highest population densities in small
forest patches. These mice are the main carrier of the
bacteria that cause Lyme disease, a debilitating illness
that is often transmitted from white-footed mice to
humans by deer ticks.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

White-footed mice are very rarely found in
unfragmented forests.
The population density for most species of
small animals increases when a continuous
area of forest becomes fragmented.
Forest fragmentation reduces the number
and variety of animal species that an area
can support.
Efforts to stop the fragmentation of forests can
have a beneficial effect on human health.
Deer ticks reach their highest population
densities in small forest patches.

3. Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles
and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically
designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such
lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is
unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the
grounds that it
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained
by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle
lanes are as serious, on average, as those
sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads
without such lanes
fails to address the possibility that there are
more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle
lanes than there are riding on roads without
such lanes
takes for granted that any road alteration that
enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances
the safety of motorists
concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads
will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on
the grounds that only some roads that currently
have such lanes are safe
takes statistical evidence that fails to support a
conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists
as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion

4. Over the last few decades, public outcries against
pollution have brought about stricter regulations of
emissions. The cities that had the most polluted air
30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality.
This would not have happened without these stricter
regulations.
Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the statements above?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

In the city with the worst air pollution today,
the air quality is better than it was 30 years ago.
No city has worse air pollution today than it
did 30 years ago.
Most of the public outcries against pollution
came from people in the cities that had the
most polluted air.
The most polluted cities today are not the cities
that were the most polluted 30 years ago.
Public criticism led to an improvement in the
air quality of the cities that had the most
polluted air 30 years ago.

5. Editorialist: Many professional musicians claim that
unauthorized music-sharing services, which allow
listeners to obtain music for free, rob musicians
of royalties. While it is true that musicians are
deprived of royalties they deserve, music-sharing
services are not to blame since record companies,
publishers, managers, and other intermediaries
take an inequitably large cut of the revenues from
music sales.
The reasoning in the editorialist’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

concludes that one party is not blameworthy
merely because another party is blameworthy
attempts to promote a particular behavior
simply by showing that many people engage
in that behavior
attacks a position based solely on the character
of the people who hold that position
tries to show that a position is false simply by
pointing out an undesirable consequence of
holding that position
treats a necessary condition for blameworthiness
as though it were a sufficient condition for
blameworthiness

6. Medical columnist: Some doctors recommend taking
vitamin C to help maintain overall health because
vitamin C is an antioxidant, a substance that
protects the body from certain types of oxygen
particles that can trigger disease. People suffering
from various ailments are encouraged to take
vitamin C to guard against developing other
health problems. However, doctors are now
discouraging some cancer patients from taking
vitamin C, even when they are undergoing
therapies with side effects that are detrimental to
their overall health.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain why the doctors’ recommendation to some
cancer patients differs from the general recommendation
regarding vitamin C?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Some kinds of cancer cells absorb large
amounts of vitamin C, which interferes with
the oxidation mechanism by which many
cancer therapies kill cancer cells.
Vitamin C has not been shown to reduce
people’s risk of developing cancer, even at
the very high dosage levels recommended
by some doctors.
Cancer cells that are susceptible to certain
types of cancer therapies are not likely to be
affected by the presence of vitamin C.
The better the overall health of cancer patients
while undergoing therapy, the more likely they
are to experience a full recovery.
Certain side effects of cancer therapies that are
detrimental to patients’ overall health are not
affected by vitamin C.

7. Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are
expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex
plantlike organisms that absorb airborne
pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to
monitor air quality. To investigate this,
I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne
copper pollution, determined the lichens’ copper
concentration, and compared the results with
those acquired using mechanical monitoring
devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best
equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively
replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices
without loss of information.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the researcher’s argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Mechanical monitoring devices have not
already been installed in areas where air
pollution is a serious problem.
Copper particles are a component of air
pollution in several locales.
Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in
areas where air pollution is minimal.
Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
Lichens absorb all other significant air
pollutants in a manner similar to their
absorption of copper.

8. Some claim that migratory birds have an innate homing
sense that allows them to return to the same areas year
after year. However, there is little evidence to support
this belief, since the studies testing whether the accuracy
of birds’ migratory patterns is due to such an innate
ability are inconclusive. After all, birds may simply
navigate using landmarks, just as humans do, and we
do not say that humans have an innate sense of
direction simply because they find their way home
time after time.
Which one of the following statements most accurately
expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)
(E)

Neither migratory birds nor humans have an
innate homing sense.
There is as yet little reason to accept that birds
have an innate homing sense.
Studies testing whether the accuracy of birds’
migratory patterns is due to an innate homing
sense are inconclusive.
The ability to use landmarks to find one’s way
home is probably not an innate ability in birds.
It is as false to claim that humans have an
innate sense of direction as it is to claim that
birds have an innate homing sense.

9. All laundry detergents contain surfactants, which can
harm aquatic life. However, the environmental effects of
most ingredients in laundry detergents, including most
of those in so-called “ecologically friendly” detergents,
are unknown. Therefore, there is no reason to suppose
that laundry detergents advertised as ecologically friendly
are less damaging to the environment than other laundry
detergents are.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens
the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Laundry detergents that are advertised as
ecologically friendly contain much lower
amounts of surfactants, on average, than
do other laundry detergents.
There is no reason to suppose that most of the
ingredients in laundry detergents not
advertised as ecologically friendly harm the
environment significantly.
Different kinds of laundry detergents contain
different kinds of surfactants, which differ in
the degree to which they could potentially
harm aquatic life.
There is reason to suppose that ingredients in
laundry detergents other than surfactants harm
the environment more than surfactants do.
Laundry detergents advertised as
environmentally friendly are typically less
effective than other detergents, so that larger
amounts must be used.

10. Fishery officials are still considering options for
eliminating Lake Davis’s population of razor-toothed
northern pike, a fierce game fish that could threaten
salmon and trout populations if it slips into the
adjoining river system. Introducing pike-specific
diseases and draining the lake have been ruled out.
Four years ago, poison was added to the lake in order
to eliminate the pike. This outraged local residents,
because the water remained tainted for months and the
region’s tourism economy suffered.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Draining the lake would not cause the region’s
tourism economy to suffer.
Four years ago was the only time that poison
was used against the pike in the lake.
The poison added to the lake four years ago was
not successful in ridding the lake of the pike.
Four years ago, fishery officials did not
consider any options other than using poison.
Salmon and trout populations in the Lake Davis
area are essential to the region’s economy.

11. Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts
are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so.
Personal conflicts arise primarily because people
are being irrational. For instance, people often
find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person
than good ones—even when there is more
evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a
friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance
may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty,
whereas a belief that someone is reliable is
normally built up only after many years of
personal interaction.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion drawn in the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Many people assume that personal conflicts
are inevitable.
Even when there is more evidence of good
qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier
to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.
It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn
one’s suspicion that a friend is unreliable into
a feeling of certainty.
Personal conflicts are not inevitable.
Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a
belief that someone is reliable is normally built
up only after many years of personal interaction.

12. Dried parsley should never be used in cooking, for it
is far less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley is.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
clearly helps to justify the argument above?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking
whenever possible.
Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be
used in cooking.
Ingredients that should never be used in cooking
are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
Parsley that is not both tasty and healthful
should never be used in cooking.
In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to
fresh ingredients.

13. The size of northern fur seals provides a reliable
indication of their population levels—the smaller the
average body size of seals in a population, the larger the
population. Archaeologists studied seal fossils covering
an 800-year period when the seals were hunted for food
by Native peoples in North America and found that the
average body size of the seals did not vary significantly.
The statements above, if true, provide the most support
for which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

During the 800-year period studied, seal
hunting practices did not vary substantially
between different groups of Native peoples
in North America.
The body size of northern fur seals is not
strongly correlated with the overall health
of the seals.
Before the 800-year period studied, the
average body size of northern fur seals
fluctuated dramatically.
Native peoples in North America made an effort
to limit their hunting of northern fur seals in
order to prevent depletion of seal populations.
Hunting by Native peoples in North America
did not significantly reduce the northern fur
seal population over the 800-year period studied.

14. Mayor: Our city faces a difficult environmental problem
caused by the enormous amount of garbage that
we must dispose of. Although new recycling
projects could greatly reduce this amount, these
projects would actually be counterproductive to
the goal of minimizing the overall amount of
environmental damage.
Which one of the following, if true, would most help to
resolve the apparent inconsistency in the mayor’s claims
about new recycling projects?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The vehicles that pick up materials for recycling
create less pollution than would be caused by
incinerating those materials.
The great costs of new recycling projects would
prevent other pollution-reducing projects from
being undertaken.
The mayor’s city has nearly exhausted its
landfill space and therefore must incinerate
much of its garbage.
More recycling would give industries in the
mayor’s city a greater incentive to use recycled
materials in their manufacturing processes.
People who recycle feel less justified in
consuming more than they need than do
people who do not recycle.

15. Anyone who knows Ellsworth knows that he is bursting
with self-righteousness, touting the idealism of his
generation over the greed of the previous generation.
So no one who knows him will be surprised that
Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media
that he has engaged in unethical business practices.
The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Everyone suspects self-righteous people of
being, in actuality, unethical.
Ellsworth has been accused of unethical
business practices before.
Hypocrites often hide behind righteous
indignation.
Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing.
Everyone expects self-righteous people to be
easily offended.

16. Political scientist: People become unenthusiastic about
voting if they believe that important problems
can be addressed only by large numbers of people
drastically changing their attitudes and that such
attitudinal changes generally do not result from
government action. The decreasing voter turnout
is thus entirely due to a growing conviction
that politicians cannot solve the most important
problems.
The reasoning in the political scientist’s argument is
most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the
argument
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

presumes, without providing justification, that
there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout
other than the belief that few important
problems can be solved by government action
presumes, without providing justification, that
there are no political solutions to the most
important problems
infers that important problems can be seriously
addressed if people’s attitudes do change from
the premise that these problems cannot be
addressed if people’s attitudes do not change
undermines its claim that people no longer
believe there are political solutions to important
problems by suggesting that people are
dissatisfied with politicians
presumes, without providing justification,
that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal
changes that result in finding solutions to
important problems

17. The conventional view is that asteroids strike the earth
at random locations, thereby randomly affecting various
aspects of the earth’s evolution. One iconoclastic
geophysicist claims instead that asteroids have struck
the earth through a highly organized natural process.
Cited as evidence is the unusual pattern of impact
craters that form a halo-like swath across the
Northern Hemisphere. There is a consensus that these
craters appeared at the end of the Cretaceous period,
followed by a mass extinction of much land and
ocean life.
Which one of the following, if true, would most help
to support the iconoclastic geophysicist’s claim?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Several asteroid strikes within a short period
could produce both volcanic activity that
warms the oceans and atmospheric debris
that blocks sunlight, and such changes could
cause mass extinctions.
If asteroids repeatedly pummel the same spots,
the beating may affect the flow of molten
rock inside the earth, which would affect the
degree to which continents drift around the
earth’s surface.
The impact craters that form a halo-like swath
across the Northern Hemisphere were the
result of a single cluster of meteors striking
the earth.
Lumpy masses within the earth cause
gravitational interactions with approaching
asteroids that force them into specific orbits
before impact.
No similar pattern of impact craters was created
during any other period of the earth’s history.

18. The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to
move the company from its current location in
Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees
cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of
Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most
Acme employees will have a commute of more than
30 minutes.
The argument requires assuming which one of the
following?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

All Acme employees can afford housing within
a 30-minute commute of Milltown.
The chairperson of Acme has good financial
reasons for wanting to move the company to
Ocean View.
None of Acme’s employees except the
chairperson are in favor of moving the
company to Ocean View.
Currently, most Acme employees have a
commute of less than 30 minutes.
Acme’s move to Ocean View will not be
accompanied by a significant pay raise for
Acme employees.

19. Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of
layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only
if the underlying layer has been properly applied.
Education is, in this respect, like the craft of
painting. Since the most important steps in
painting are preparation of the surface to be
painted and application of the primer coat,
it makes sense to suppose that _______.
Which one of the following most logically completes
the editorial’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

in the educator’s initial contact with a student,
the educator should be as undemanding as
possible
students who have a secure grasp of the
fundamentals of a subject are likely to make
progress in that subject
educators who are not achieving the goals they
intended should revise their teaching methods
teaching new students is rewarding but much
more difficult than teaching more advanced
students
the success of a student’s overall educational
experience depends above all upon that
student’s initial educational experience

20. Scientist: Given the human tendency to explore and
colonize new areas, some people believe that the
galaxy will eventually be colonized by trillions
of humans. If so, the vast majority of humans ever
to live would be alive during this period of
colonization. Since all of us are humans and we
have no reason to think we are unrepresentative,
the odds are overwhelming that we would be
alive during this period, too. But, because we are
not alive during this period, the odds are slim
that such colonization will ever happen.
The scientist’s argument proceeds by
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

reasoning that because an event has not occurred,
that event has a low probability of occurring
drawing a conclusion that implicitly contradicts
one of the premises that the argument accepts
taking for granted that dependable predictions
about the future cannot ever be made simply
on the basis of the present facts
inferring that since an event that is taken to be
likely on a given hypothesis has not occurred,
the hypothesis is probably false
making a prediction far into the future based
on established human tendencies

21. Professor Riley characterized the university president’s
speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore
inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing
feud with the president, and so we should not conclude
that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of
Riley’s testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent
reasons to deem the president’s speech inflammatory,
it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.

22. Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over
the past several years has forced us to choose
between devoting some airtime to other, more
popular genres of music, and sticking with
classical music that appeals only to our small but
loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did
not generate enough advertising revenue for us to
pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our
station risks going out of business. We should not
take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some
airtime to other, more popular genres of music.
Which one of the following arguments is most similar in
its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

The argument is flawed in that it
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

takes for granted that the speech could not be
inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
fails to adequately address the possibility that
inflammatory speeches may be appropriate
for some audiences
favors the university president’s side in a
dispute simply because of the president’s
privileged standing
concludes that Riley’s claim is false merely on
the grounds that Riley has something to gain
if the claim is accepted as true
fails to adequately address the possibility that
Riley’s animosity toward the university
president is well founded

(E)

We should either buy blinds for the windows
or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be
very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is
our greatest concern, we should make curtains.
We should either make curtains for the windows
or buy blinds. Since the windows are not
standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have
to special order them. Since we do not have
time to wait for special orders, we should
make the curtains.
For the living room windows, we can make
curtains or valances or both. We want to have
privacy; and while curtains provide privacy,
valances do not. So we should make curtains
but not valances.
Since we have very little fabric, we will have
to either buy more, or make valances instead
of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to
make valances, then we will have to buy
blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric
that matches what we already have, we should
buy blinds.
We should either buy blinds or make curtains
for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not
make valances, the windows will look bare.
We should not have bare windows. So if we
do not make the curtains, we should make
the valances.

23. Art historian: This painting, purportedly by Mary Cassatt,
is a forgery. Although the canvas and other
materials are consistent with most of Cassatt’s
work, and the subject matter is similar to that of
Cassatt’s finest paintings, the brush style of this
painting is not found in any work known to be
Cassatt’s. Hence this painting is definitely not a
genuine Cassatt.
The art historian’s argument depends on assuming
which one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

The type of canvas and other materials that
Cassatt used in most of her work were readily
available to others.
None of Cassatt’s works is painted using a
brush style that is not exhibited in any of her
known works.
Cassatt’s work generally had a characteristic
subject matter that distinguished it from the
work of other painters of her era.
The most characteristic feature of Cassatt’s
work is her brush style.
No painter other than Cassatt would be able to
match Cassatt’s brush style perfectly.

25. Alissa: If, as the mayor says, the city can no longer
continue to fund both the children’s museum and
local children’s television programming, then it
should cease funding the television programming.
The interactive character of the exhibits at the
museum makes for a richer educational experience
than watching television, which is largely passive.
Greta: We should stop funding the museum, not the
television programming, because, as the mayor
has also pointed out, the museum reaches a
much smaller audience.
On the basis of their statements, it can be inferred
that Alissa and Greta disagree on which one of the
following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

24. In the Riverview Building, every apartment that has a
balcony also has a fireplace. None of the apartments
with balconies is a one-bedroom apartment. So none
