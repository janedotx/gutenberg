SECTION I
Time—35 minutes
25 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Backyard gardeners who want to increase the yields of
their potato plants should try growing stinging nettles
alongside the plants, since stinging nettles attract insects
that kill a wide array of insect pests that damage potato
plants. It is true that stinging nettles also attract aphids,
and that many species of aphids are harmful to potato
plants, but that fact in no way contradicts this
recommendation, because _______.

3. A recent survey quizzed journalism students about the
sorts of stories they themselves wished to read.
A significant majority said they wanted to see stories
dealing with serious governmental and political issues and
had little tolerance for the present popularity of stories
covering lifestyle trends and celebrity gossip. This
indicates that today’s trends in publishing are based on
false assumptions about the interests of the public.

Which one of the following most logically completes
the argument?

Which one of the following most accurately describes
a flaw in the argument’s reasoning?

(A)

(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

stinging nettles require little care and thus are
easy to cultivate
some types of aphids are attracted to stinging
nettle plants but do not damage them
the types of aphids that stinging nettles attract
do not damage potato plants
insect pests typically cause less damage to
potato plants than other harmful organisms do
most aphid species that are harmful to potato
plants cause greater harm to other edible
food plants

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)
2. Jocko, a chimpanzee, was once given a large bunch of
bananas by a zookeeper after the more dominant
members of the chimpanzee’s troop had wandered off.
In his excitement, Jocko uttered some loud “food
barks.” The other chimpanzees returned and took the
bananas away. The next day, Jocko was again found
alone and was given a single banana. This time,
however, he kept silent. The zookeeper concluded that
Jocko’s silence was a stratagem to keep the other
chimpanzees from his food.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously calls
into question the zookeeper’s conclusion?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Chimpanzees utter food barks only when their
favorite foods are available.
Chimpanzees utter food barks only when they
encounter a sizable quantity of food.
Chimpanzees frequently take food from other
chimpanzees merely to assert dominance.
Even when they are alone, chimpanzees often
make noises that appear to be signals to
other chimpanzees.
Bananas are a food for which all of the
chimpanzees at the zoo show a decided
preference.

It takes what is more likely to be the effect of
a phenomenon to be its cause.
It regards the production of an effect as
incontrovertible evidence of an intention to
produce that effect.
It relies on the opinions of a group unlikely to
be representative of the group at issue in the
conclusion.
It employs language that unfairly represents
those who are likely to reject the argument’s
conclusion.
It treats a hypothesis as fact even though it is
admittedly unsupported.

4. Electric bug zappers, which work by attracting insects to
light, are a very effective means of ridding an area of
flying insects. Despite this, most pest control experts
now advise against their use, recommending instead
such remedies as insect-eating birds or insecticide sprays.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
account for the pest control experts’ recommendation?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Insect-eating birds will take up residence in any
insect-rich area if they are provided with
nesting boxes, food, and water.
Bug zappers are less effective against mosquitoes,
which are among the more harmful insects, than
they are against other harmful insects.
Bug zappers use more electricity but provide
less light than do most standard outdoor light
sources.
Bug zappers kill many more beneficial insects
and fewer harmful insects than do insect-eating
birds and insecticide sprays.
Developers of certain new insecticide sprays
claim that their products contain no chemicals
that are harmful to humans, birds, or pets.

6. Small experimental vacuum tubes can operate in heat
that makes semiconductor components fail. Any
component whose resistance to heat is greater than that
of semiconductors would be preferable for use in digital
circuits, but only if that component were also comparable
to semiconductors in all other significant respects, such
as maximum current capacity. However, vacuum tubes’
maximum current capacity is presently not comparable
to that of semiconductors.
If the statements above are true, which one of the
following must also be true?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)
5. Gardener: The design of Japanese gardens should
display harmony with nature. Hence, rocks
chosen for placement in such gardens should
vary widely in appearance, since rocks found in
nature also vary widely in appearance.
The gardener’s argument depends on assuming which
one of the following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

The selection of rocks for placement in a
Japanese garden should reflect every key value
embodied in the design of Japanese gardens.
In the selection of rocks for Japanese gardens,
imitation of nature helps to achieve harmony
with nature.
The only criterion for selecting rocks for
placement in a Japanese garden is the expression
of harmony with nature.
Expressing harmony with nature and being
natural are the same thing.
Each component of a genuine Japanese
garden is varied.

Vacuum tubes are not now preferable to
semiconductors for use in digital circuits.
Once vacuum tubes and semiconductors have
comparable maximum current capacity, vacuum
tubes will be used in some digital circuits.
The only reason that vacuum tubes are not now
used in digital circuits is that vacuum tubes’
maximum current capacity is too low.
Semiconductors will always be preferable to
vacuum tubes for use in many applications
other than digital circuits.
Resistance to heat is the only advantage that
vacuum tubes have over semiconductors.

7. The cause of the epidemic that devastated Athens in
430 B.C. can finally be identified. Accounts of the
epidemic mention the hiccups experienced by many
victims, a symptom of no known disease except that
caused by the recently discovered Ebola virus.
Moreover, other symptoms of the disease caused by
the Ebola virus are mentioned in the accounts of the
Athenian epidemic.
Each of the following, if true, weakens the argument
EXCEPT:
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Victims of the Ebola virus experience many
symptoms that do not appear in any of the
accounts of the Athenian epidemic.
Not all of those who are victims of the Ebola
virus are afflicted with hiccups.
The Ebola virus’s host animals did not live in
Athens at the time of the Athenian epidemic.
The Ebola virus is much more contagious than
the disease that caused the Athenian epidemic
was reported to have been.
The epidemics known to have been caused by
the Ebola virus are usually shorter-lived than
was the Athenian epidemic.

8. Letter to the editor: Your article was unjustified in
criticizing environmentalists for claiming that
more wolves on Vancouver Island are killed by
hunters than are born each year. You stated that
this claim was disproven by recent studies that
indicate that the total number of wolves on
Vancouver Island has remained roughly constant
for 20 years. But you failed to account for the fact
that, fearing the extinction of this wolf population,
environmentalists have been introducing new
wolves into the Vancouver Island wolf population
for 20 years.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion of the argument in the letter to the editor?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Environmentalists have been successfully
maintaining the wolf population on
Vancouver Island for 20 years.
As many wolves on Vancouver Island are killed
by hunters as are born each year.
The population of wolves on Vancouver Island
should be maintained by either reducing the
number killed by hunters each year or
introducing new wolves into the population.
The recent studies indicating that the total
number of wolves on Vancouver Island has
remained roughly constant for 20 years
were flawed.
The stability in the size of the Vancouver Island
wolf population does not warrant the article’s
criticism of the environmentalists’ claim.

9. Computer scientist: For several decades, the number of
transistors on new computer microchips, and
hence the microchips’ computing speed, has
doubled about every 18 months. However, from
the mid-1990s into the next decade, each such
doubling in a microchip’s computing speed was
accompanied by a doubling in the cost of
producing that microchip.
Which one of the following can be properly inferred
from the computer scientist’s statements?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The only effective way to double the computing
speed of computer microchips is to increase
the number of transistors per microchip.
From the mid-1990s into the next decade, there
was little if any increase in the retail cost of
computers as a result of the increased number
of transistors on microchips.
For the last several decades, computer
engineers have focused on increasing the
computing speed of computer microchips
without making any attempt to control the
cost of producing them.
From the mid-1990s into the next decade, a
doubling in the cost of fabricating new computer
microchips accompanied each doubling in the
number of transistors on those microchips.
It is unlikely that engineers will ever be able
to increase the computing speed of microchips
without also increasing the cost of producing
them.

10. Ms. Sandstrom’s newspaper column describing a strange
natural phenomenon on the Mendels’ farm led many
people to trespass on and extensively damage their
property. Thus, Ms. Sandstrom should pay for this
damage if, as the Mendels claim, she could have
reasonably expected that the column would lead people
to damage the Mendels’ farm.
The argument’s conclusion can be properly inferred if
which one of the following is assumed?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

One should pay for any damage that one’s
action leads other people to cause if one could
have reasonably expected that the action would
lead other people to cause damage.
One should pay for damage that one’s action
leads other people to cause only if, prior to the
action, one expected that the action would lead
other people to cause that damage.
It is unlikely that the people who trespassed
on and caused the damage to the Mendels’
property would themselves pay for the damage
they caused.
Ms. Sandstrom knew that her column could
incite trespassing that could result in damage
to the Mendels’ farm.
The Mendels believe that Ms. Sandstrom is able
to form reasonable expectations about the
consequences of her actions.

11. Meyer was found by his employer to have committed
scientific fraud by falsifying data. The University of
Williamstown, from which Meyer held a PhD, validated
this finding and subsequently investigated whether he
had falsified data in his doctoral thesis, finding no
evidence that he had. But the university decided to
revoke Meyer’s PhD anyway.
Which one of the following university policies most
justifies the decision to revoke Meyer’s PhD?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Anyone who holds a PhD from the University
of Williamstown and is found to have
committed academic fraud in the course of
pursuing that PhD will have the PhD revoked.
No PhD program at the University of
Williamstown will admit any applicant who
has been determined to have committed any
sort of academic fraud.
Any University of Williamstown student who
is found to have submitted falsified data as
academic work will be dismissed from the
university.
Anyone who holds a PhD from the University
of Williamstown and is found to have committed
scientific fraud will have the PhD revoked.
The University of Williamstown will not hire
anyone who is under investigation for
scientific fraud.

12. Aerobics instructor: Compared to many forms of
exercise, kickboxing aerobics is highly risky.
Overextending when kicking often leads to hip,
knee, or lower-back injuries. Such overextension
is very likely to occur when beginners try to
match the high kicks of more skilled practitioners.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the aerobics instructor’s statements?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Skilled practitioners of kickboxing aerobics
are unlikely to experience injuries from
overextending while kicking.
To reduce the risk of injuries, beginners at
kickboxing aerobics should avoid trying to
match the high kicks of more skilled
practitioners.
Beginners at kickboxing aerobics will not
experience injuries if they avoid trying to
match the high kicks of more skilled
practitioners.
Kickboxing aerobics is more risky than forms of
aerobic exercise that do not involve high kicks.
Most beginners at kickboxing aerobics
experience injuries from trying to match the
high kicks of more skilled practitioners.

13. A large company has been convicted of engaging in
monopolistic practices. The penalty imposed on the
company will probably have little if any effect on its
behavior. Still, the trial was worthwhile, since it
provided useful information about the company’s
practices. After all, this information has emboldened the
company’s direct competitors, alerted potential rivals,
and forced the company to restrain its unfair behavior
toward customers and competitors.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the overall conclusion drawn in the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Even if the company had not been convicted
of engaging in monopolistic practices, the trial
probably would have had some effect on the
company’s behavior.
The light shed on the company’s practices by
the trial has emboldened its competitors,
alerted potential rivals, and forced the
company to restrain its unfair behavior.
The penalty imposed on the company will likely
have little or no effect on its behavior.
The company’s trial on charges of engaging in
monopolistic practices was worthwhile.
The penalty imposed on the company in the
trial should have been larger.

14. Waller: If there were really such a thing as extrasensory
perception, it would generally be accepted by the
public since anyone with extrasensory powers
would be able to convince the general public of its
existence by clearly demonstrating those powers.
Indeed, anyone who was recognized to have such
powers would achieve wealth and renown.
Chin: It’s impossible to demonstrate anything to the
satisfaction of all skeptics. So long as the cultural
elite remains closed-minded to the possibility of
extrasensory perception, the popular media
reports, and thus public opinion, will always be
biased in favor of such skeptics.
Waller’s and Chin’s statements commit them to
disagreeing on whether
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

extrasensory perception is a real phenomenon
extrasensory perception, if it were a real
phenomenon, could be demonstrated to the
satisfaction of all skeptics
skeptics about extrasensory perception have a
weak case
the failure of the general public to believe in
extrasensory perception is good evidence
against its existence
the general public believes that extrasensory
perception is a real phenomenon

15. Counselor: Hagerle sincerely apologized to the physician
for lying to her. So Hagerle owes me a sincere
apology as well, because Hagerle told the same
lie to both of us.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the counselor’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is good to apologize for having done
something wrong to a person if one is capable
of doing so sincerely.
If someone tells the same lie to two different
people, then neither of those lied to is owed
an apology unless both are.
Someone is owed a sincere apology for having
been lied to by a person if someone else has
already received a sincere apology for the
same lie from that same person.
If one is capable of sincerely apologizing to
someone for lying to them, then one owes
that person such an apology.
A person should not apologize to someone for
telling a lie unless he or she can sincerely
apologize to all others to whom the lie was told.

16. A survey of address changes filed with post offices and
driver’s license bureaus over the last ten years has
established that households moving out of the city of
Weston outnumbered households moving into the city
two to one. Therefore, we can expect that next year’s
census, which counts all residents regardless of age,
will show that the population of Weston has declined
since the last census ten years ago.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps
strengthen the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Within the past decade many people both
moved into the city and also moved out of it.
Over the past century any census of Weston
showing a population loss was followed ten years
later by a census showing a population gain.
Many people moving into Weston failed to
notify either the post office or the driver’s
license bureau that they had moved to the city.
Most adults moving out of Weston were parents
who had children living with them, whereas
most adults remaining in or moving into the
city were older people who lived alone.
Most people moving out of Weston were young
adults who were hoping to begin a career
elsewhere, whereas most adults remaining in
or moving into the city had long-standing jobs
in the city.

17. Psychologist: People tend to make certain cognitive
errors when they predict how a given event
would affect their future happiness. But people
should not necessarily try to rid themselves of
this tendency. After all, in a visual context, lines
that are actually parallel often appear to people as
if they converge. If a surgeon offered to restructure
your eyes and visual cortex so that parallel lines
would no longer ever appear to converge, it
would not be reasonable to take the surgeon up
on the offer.
The psychologist’s argument does which one of the
following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

attempts to refute a claim that a particular
event is inevitable by establishing the
possibility of an alternative event
attempts to undermine a theory by calling into
question an assumption on which the theory
is based
argues that an action might not be appropriate
by suggesting that a corresponding action in
an analogous situation is not appropriate
argues that two situations are similar by
establishing that the same action would be
reasonable in each situation
attempts to establish a generalization and then
uses that generalization to argue against a
particular action

18. Principle: Even if an art auction house identifies the
descriptions in its catalog as opinions, it is guilty
of misrepresentation if such a description is a
deliberate attempt to mislead bidders.
Application: Although Healy’s, an art auction house,
states that all descriptions in its catalog are opinions,
Healy’s was guilty of misrepresentation when its
catalog described a vase as dating from the
mid-eighteenth century when it was actually a
modern reproduction.
Which one of the following, if true, most justifies the
above application of the principle?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

An authentic work of art from the
mid-eighteenth century will usually sell for
at least ten times more than a modern
reproduction of a similar work from that period.
Although pottery that is similar to the vase is
currently extremely popular among art
collectors, none of the collectors who are
knowledgeable about such pottery were
willing to bid on the vase.
The stated policy of Healy’s is to describe
works in its catalogs only in terms of their
readily perceptible qualities and not to include
any information about their age.
Some Healy’s staff members believe that the
auction house’s catalog should not contain any
descriptions that have not been certified to be
true by independent experts.
Without consulting anyone with expertise in
authenticating vases, Healy’s described the
vase as dating from the mid-eighteenth century
merely in order to increase its auction price.

19. Anthropologist: It was formerly believed that prehistoric
Homo sapiens ancestors of contemporary humans
interbred with Neanderthals, but DNA testing of a
Neanderthal’s remains indicates that this is not the
case. The DNA of contemporary humans is
significantly different from that of the Neanderthal.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the anthropologist’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

At least some Neanderthals lived at the same
time and in the same places as prehistoric Homo
sapiens ancestors of contemporary humans.
DNA testing of remains is significantly less
reliable than DNA testing of samples from
living species.
The DNA of prehistoric Homo sapiens ancestors
of contemporary humans was not significantly
more similar to that of Neanderthals than is the
DNA of contemporary humans.
Neanderthals and prehistoric Homo sapiens
ancestors of contemporary humans were
completely isolated from each other
geographically.
Any similarity in the DNA of two species must
be the result of interbreeding.

20. Council member: The profits of downtown businesses
will increase if more consumers live in the
downtown area, and a decrease in the cost of
living in the downtown area will guarantee that
the number of consumers living there will
increase. However, the profits of downtown
businesses will not increase unless downtown
traffic congestion decreases.
If all the council member’s statements are true, which
one of the following must be true?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

If downtown traffic congestion decreases, the
number of consumers living in the downtown
area will increase.
If the cost of living in the downtown area
decreases, the profits of downtown businesses
will increase.
If downtown traffic congestion decreases, the
cost of living in the downtown area will increase.
If downtown traffic congestion decreases, the
cost of living in the downtown area will
decrease.
If the profits of downtown businesses increase,
the number of consumers living in the
downtown area will increase.

21. On the Discount Phoneline, any domestic long-distance
call starting between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. costs 15 cents a
minute, and any other domestic long-distance call costs
10 cents a minute. So any domestic long-distance call
on the Discount Phoneline that does not cost 10 cents
a minute costs 15 cents a minute.
The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following
arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If a university class involves extensive lab
work, the class will be conducted in a
laboratory; otherwise, it will be conducted in a
normal classroom. Thus, if a university class
does not involve extensive lab work, it will not
be conducted in a laboratory.
If a university class involves extensive lab

22. One child pushed another child from behind, injuring
the second child. The first child clearly understands the
difference between right and wrong, so what was done
was wrong if it was intended to injure the second child.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

An action that is intended to harm another
person is wrong only if the person who
performed the action understands the
difference between right and wrong.
It is wrong for a person who understands the
difference between right and wrong to
intentionally harm another person.
Any act that is wrong is done with the
intention of causing harm.
An act that harms another person is wrong if
the person who did it understands the
difference between right and wrong and did
not think about whether the act would injure
the other person.
A person who does not understand the difference
between right and wrong does not bear any
responsibility for harming another person.

23. Researcher: Each subject in this experiment owns one
car, and was asked to estimate what proportion of
all automobiles registered in the nation are the
same make as the subject’s car. The estimate of
nearly every subject has been significantly higher
than the actual national statistic for the make of
that subject’s car. I hypothesize that certain makes
of car are more common in some regions of the
nation than in other regions; obviously, that
would lead many people to overestimate how
common their make of car is nationally. That is
precisely the result found in this experiment, so
certain makes of car must indeed be more common
in some areas of the nation than in others.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
a reasoning flaw in the researcher’s argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The argument fails to estimate the likelihood
that most subjects in the experiment did not
know the actual statistics about how common
their make of car is nationwide.
The argument treats a result that supports a
hypothesis as a result that proves a hypothesis.
The argument fails to take into account the
possibility that the subject pool may come
from a wide variety of geographical regions.
The argument attempts to draw its main
conclusion from a set of premises that are
mutually contradictory.
The argument applies a statistical generalization
to a particular case to which it was not intended
to apply.

24. In university towns, police issue far more parking
citations during the school year than they do during
the times when the students are out of town. Therefore,
we know that most parking citations in university towns
are issued to students.
Which one of the following is most similar in its flawed
reasoning to the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

We know that children buy most of the snacks
at cinemas, because popcorn sales increase as
the proportion of child moviegoers to adult
moviegoers increases.
We know that this houseplant gets more of the
sunlight from the window, because it is greener
than that houseplant.
We know that most people who go to a
university are studious because most of those
people study while they attend the university.
We know that consumers buy more fruit during
the summer than they buy during the winter,
because there are far more varieties of fruit
available in the summer than in the winter.
We know that most of the snacks parents buy
go to other people’s children, because when
other people’s children come to visit, parents
give out more snacks than usual.

25. Counselor: Those who believe that criticism should be
gentle rather than harsh should consider the
following: change requires a motive, and criticism
that is unpleasant provides a motive. Since harsh
criticism is unpleasant, harsh criticism provides a
motive. Therefore, only harsh criticism will cause
the person criticized to change.
The reasoning in the counselor’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

infers that something that is sufficient to provide
a motive is necessary to provide a motive
fails to address the possibility that in some
cases the primary goal of criticism is
something other than bringing about change
in the person being criticized
takes for granted that everyone who is
motivated to change will change
confuses a motive for doing something with a
motive for avoiding something
takes the refutation of an argument to be
sufficient to show that the argument’s
conclusion is false

Time—35 minutes
26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Commentator: In last week’s wreck involving one of
Acme Engines’ older locomotives, the engineer
lost control of the train when his knee accidentally
struck a fuel shut-down switch. Acme claims it is
not liable because it never realized that the
knee-level switches were a safety hazard. When
asked why it relocated knee-level switches in its
newer locomotives, Acme said engineers had
complained that they were simply inconvenient.
However, it is unlikely that Acme would have
spent the $500,000 it took to relocate switches in
the newer locomotives merely because of
inconvenience. Thus, Acme Engines should be
held liable for last week’s wreck.
The point that Acme Engines spent $500,000 relocating
knee-level switches in its newer locomotives is offered
in the commentator’s argument as
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

proof that the engineer is not at all responsible
for the train wreck
a reason for believing that the wreck would
have occurred even if Acme Engines had
remodeled their older locomotives
an explanation of why the train wreck occurred
evidence that knee-level switches are not in
fact hazardous
an indication that Acme Engines had been
aware of the potential dangers of knee-level
switches before the wreck occurred

2. Artist: Almost everyone in this country really wants to
be an artist even though they may have to work
other jobs to pay the rent. After all, just about
everyone I know hopes to someday be able to
make a living as a painter, musician, or poet even
if they currently work as dishwashers or discount
store clerks.
The reasoning in the artist’s argument is flawed in that
the argument
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

contains a premise that presupposes the truth of
the conclusion
presumes that what is true of each person in a
country is also true of the country’s population
as a whole
defends a view solely on the grounds that the
view is widely held
bases its conclusion on a sample that is unlikely
to accurately represent people in the country as
a whole
fails to make a needed distinction between
wanting to be an artist and making a living as
an artist

3. The qwerty keyboard became the standard keyboard
with the invention of the typewriter and remains the
standard for typing devices today. If an alternative known
as the Dvorak keyboard were today’s standard, typists
would type significantly faster. Nevertheless, it is not
practical to switch to the Dvorak keyboard because the
cost to society of switching, in terms of time, money,
and frustration, would be greater than the benefits that
would be ultimately gained from faster typing.
The example above best illustrates which one of the
following propositions?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Often it is not worthwhile to move to a process
that improves speed if it comes at the expense
of accuracy.
People usually settle on a standard because that
standard is more efficient than any alternatives.
People often remain with an entrenched standard
rather than move to a more efficient alternative
simply because they dislike change.
The emotional cost associated with change is a
factor that sometimes outweighs financial
considerations.
The fact that a standard is already in wide use
can be a crucial factor in making it a more
practical choice than an alternative.

4. Sam: Mountain lions, a protected species, are preying
on bighorn sheep, another protected species. We
must let nature take its course and hope the
bighorns survive.
Meli: Nonsense. We must do what we can to ensure the
survival of the bighorn, even if that means
limiting the mountain lion population.

6. A transit company’s bus drivers are evaluated by
supervisors riding with each driver. Drivers complain
that this affects their performance, but because the
supervisor’s presence affects every driver’s performance,
those drivers performing best with a supervisor aboard
will likely also be the best drivers under normal
conditions.

Which one of the following is a point of disagreement
between Meli and Sam?

Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?

(A)

(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Humans should not intervene to protect bighorn
sheep from mountain lions.
The preservation of a species as a whole is more
important than the loss of a few individuals.
The preservation of a predatory species is easier
to ensure than the preservation of the species
preyed upon.
Any measures to limit the mountain lion
population would likely push the species to
extinction.
If the population of mountain lions is not limited,
the bighorn sheep species will not survive.

5. Parent: Pushing very young children into rigorous study
in an effort to make our nation more competitive
does more harm than good. Curricula for these
young students must address their special
developmental needs, and while rigorous work in
secondary school makes sense, the same approach
in the early years of primary school produces only
short-term gains and may cause young children to
burn out on schoolwork. Using very young
students as pawns in the race to make the nation
economically competitive is unfair and may
ultimately work against us.
Which one of the following can be inferred from the
parent’s statements?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

For our nation to be competitive, our secondary
school curriculum must include more rigorous
study than it now does.
The developmental needs of secondary school
students are not now being addressed in our
high schools.
Our country can be competitive only if the
developmental needs of all our students can
be met.
A curriculum of rigorous study does not
adequately address the developmental needs
of primary school students.
Unless our nation encourages more rigorous
study in the early years of primary school, we
cannot be economically competitive.

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

There is no effective way of evaluating the bus
drivers’ performance without having
supervisors ride with them.
The supervisors are excellent judges of a bus
driver’s performance.
For most bus drivers, the presence of a
supervisor makes their performance slightly
worse than it otherwise would be.
The bus drivers are each affected in roughly the
same way and to the same extent by the
presence of the supervisor.
The bus drivers themselves are able to deliver
accurate assessments of their driving
performance.

7. Economic growth accelerates business demand for the
development of new technologies. Businesses supplying
these new technologies are relatively few, while those
wishing to buy them are many. Yet an acceleration of
technological change can cause suppliers as well as
buyers of new technologies to fail.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Businesses supplying new technologies are
more likely to prosper in times of accelerated
technological change than other businesses.
Businesses that supply new technologies may
not always benefit from economic growth.
The development of new technologies may
accelerate economic growth in general.
Businesses that adopt new technologies are
most likely to prosper in a period of general
economic growth.
Economic growth increases business failures.

8. Energy analyst: During this record-breaking heat wave,
air conditioner use has overloaded the region’s
electrical power grid, resulting in frequent power
blackouts throughout the region. For this reason,
residents have been asked to cut back voluntarily
on air conditioner use in their homes. But even if
this request is heeded, blackouts will probably
occur unless the heat wave abates.

10. Editorial: Many critics of consumerism insist that
advertising persuades people that they need
certain consumer goods when they merely desire
them. However, this accusation rests on a fuzzy
distinction, that between wants and needs. In life,
it is often impossible to determine whether
something is merely desirable or whether it is
essential to one’s happiness.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve
the apparent discrepancy in the information above?

Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the conclusion drawn in the editorial’s argument?

(A)

(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Air-conditioning is not the only significant drain
on the electrical system in the area.
Most air-conditioning in the region is used to
cool businesses and factories.
Most air-conditioning systems could be made
more energy efficient by implementing simple
design modifications.
Residents of the region are not likely to reduce
their air conditioner use voluntarily during
particularly hot weather.
The heat wave is expected to abate in the near
future.

9. Long-term and short-term relaxation training are two
common forms of treatment for individuals experiencing
problematic levels of anxiety. Yet studies show that on
average, regardless of which form of treatment one
receives, symptoms of anxiety decrease to a normal
level within the short-term-training time period. Thus,
for most people the generally more expensive long-term
training is unwarranted.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the
argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A decrease in symptoms of anxiety often occurs
even with no treatment or intervention by a
mental health professional.
Short-term relaxation training conducted by a
more experienced practitioner can be more
expensive than long-term training conducted
by a less experienced practitioner.
Recipients of long-term training are much less
likely than recipients of short-term training to
have recurrences of problematic levels of anxiety.
The fact that an individual thinks that a treatment
will reduce his or her anxiety tends, in and of
itself, to reduce the individual’s anxiety.
Short-term relaxation training involves the
teaching of a wider variety of anxiety-combating
relaxation techniques than does long-term
training.

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

The claim that advertising persuades people that
they need things that they merely want rests on
a fuzzy distinction.
Many critics of consumerism insist that advertising
attempts to blur people’s ability to distinguish
between wants and needs.
There is nothing wrong with advertising that
tries to persuade people that they need certain
consumer goods.
Many critics of consumerism fail to realize that
certain things are essential to human happiness.
Critics of consumerism often use fuzzy
distinctions to support their claims.

11. People who browse the web for medical information
often cannot discriminate between scientifically valid
information and quackery. Much of the quackery is
particularly appealing to readers with no medical
background because it is usually written more clearly
than scientific papers. Thus, people who rely on the web
when attempting to diagnose their medical conditions
are likely to do themselves more harm than good.
Which one of the following is an assumption the
argument requires?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

People who browse the web for medical
information typically do so in an attempt to
diagnose their medical conditions.
People who attempt to diagnose their medical
conditions are likely to do themselves more
harm than good unless they rely exclusively
on scientifically valid information.
People who have sufficient medical knowledge
to discriminate between scientifically valid
information and quackery will do themselves
no harm if they rely on the web when attempting
to diagnose their medical conditions.
Many people who browse the web assume that
information is not scientifically valid unless it
is clearly written.
People attempting to diagnose their medical
conditions will do themselves more harm than
good only if they rely on quackery instead of
scientifically valid information.

12. When adults toss balls to very young children they
generally try to toss them as slowly as possible to
compensate for the children’s developing coordination.
But recent studies show that despite their developing
coordination, children actually have an easier time
catching balls that are thrown at a faster speed.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain why very young children find it easier to catch
balls that are thrown at a faster speed?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Balls thrown at a faster speed, unlike balls
thrown at a slower speed, trigger regions in the
brain that control the tracking of objects for
self-defense.
Balls that are tossed more slowly tend to have a
higher arc that makes it less likely that the ball
will be obscured by the body of the adult
tossing it.
Adults generally find it easier to catch balls that
are thrown slowly than balls that are thrown at
a faster speed.
Children are able to toss balls back to the adults
with more accuracy when they throw fast than
when they throw the ball back more slowly.
There is a limit to how fast the balls can be
tossed to the children before the children start
to have more difficulty in catching them.

13. Like a genetic profile, a functional magnetic-resonance
image (fMRI) of the brain can contain information that
a patient wishes to keep private. An fMRI of a brain
also contains enough information about a patient’s skull
to create a recognizable image of that patient’s face. A
genetic profile can be linked to a patient only by
referring to labels or records.
The statements above, if true, most strongly support
which one of the following?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is not important that medical providers apply
labels to fMRIs of patients’ brains.
An fMRI has the potential to compromise
patient privacy in circumstances in which a
genetic profile would not.
In most cases patients cannot be reasonably sure
that the information in a genetic profile will be
kept private.
Most of the information contained in an fMRI
of a person’s brain is also contained in that
person’s genetic profile.
Patients are more concerned about threats to
privacy posed by fMRIs than they are about
those posed by genetic profiles.

14. Council member: I recommend that the abandoned shoe
factory be used as a municipal emergency shelter.
Some council members assert that the courthouse
would be a better shelter site, but they have
provided no evidence of this. Thus, the shoe
factory would be a better shelter site.
A questionable technique used in the council member’s
argument is that of
(A)

asserting that a lack of evidence against a view
is proof that the view is correct
accepting a claim simply because advocates of
an opposing claim have not adequately defended
their view

15. It was misleading for James to tell the Core Curriculum
Committee that the chair of the Anthropology Department
had endorsed his proposal. The chair of the Anthropology
Department had told James that his proposal had her
endorsement, but only if the draft proposal she saw
included all the recommendations James would ultimately
make to the Core Curriculum Committee.
The argument relies on which one of the following
assumptions?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

If the chair of the Anthropology Department did
not endorse James’s proposed recommendations,
the Core Curriculum Committee would be
unlikely to implement them.
The chair of the Anthropology Department
would have been opposed to any
recommendations James proposed to the
Core Curriculum Committee other than those
she had seen.
James thought that the Core Curriculum
Committee would implement the proposed
recommendations only if they believed that the
recommendations had been endorsed by the
chair of the Anthropology Department.
James thought that the chair of the
Anthropology Department would have
endorsed all of the recommendations that he
proposed to the Core Curriculum Committee.
The draft proposal that the chair of the
Anthropology Department had seen did not
include all of the recommendations in James’s
proposal to the Core Curriculum Committee.

16. Travaillier Corporation has recently hired employees
with experience in the bus tour industry, and its
executives have also been negotiating with charter bus
companies that subcontract with bus tour companies.
But Travaillier has traditionally focused on serving
consumers who travel primarily by air, and marketing
surveys show that Travaillier’s traditional consumers
have not changed their vacation preferences. Therefore,
Travaillier must be attempting to enlarge its consumer
base by attracting new customers.
Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken
the argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In the past, Travaillier has found it very difficult
to change its customers’ vacation preferences.
Several travel companies other than Travaillier
have recently tried and failed to expand into
the bus tour business.
At least one of Travaillier’s new employees not
only has experience in the bus tour industry
but has also designed air travel vacation
packages.
Some of Travaillier’s competitors have increased
profits by concentrating their attention on their
customers who spend the most on vacations.
The industry consultants employed by Travaillier
typically recommend that companies expand by
introducing their current customers to new
products and services.

17. Educator: Traditional classroom education is ineffective
because education in such an environment is not
truly a social process and only social processes
can develop students’ insights. In the traditional
classroom, the teacher acts from outside the group
and interaction between teachers and students is
rigid and artificial.
The educator’s conclusion follows logically if which one
of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Development of insight takes place only if
genuine education also occurs.
Classroom education is effective if the
interaction between teachers and students is
neither rigid nor artificial.
All social processes involve interaction that is
neither rigid nor artificial.
Education is not effective unless it leads to the
development of insight.
The teacher does not act from outside the group
in a nontraditional classroom.

18. The probability of avoiding heart disease is increased if
one avoids fat in one’s diet. Furthermore, one is less
likely to eat fat if one avoids eating dairy foods. Thus
the probability of maintaining good health is increased
by avoiding dairy foods.
The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to
criticism on which one of the following grounds?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The argument ignores the possibility that, even
though a practice may have potentially negative
consequences, its elimination may also have
negative consequences.
The argument fails to consider the possibility
that there are more ways than one of decreasing
the risk of a certain type of occurrence.
The argument presumes, without providing
justification, that factors that carry increased
risks of negative consequences ought to be
eliminated.
The argument fails to show that the evidence
appealed to is relevant to the conclusion
asserted.
The argument fails to consider that what is
probable will not necessarily occur.

19. Professor: One cannot frame an accurate conception of
one’s physical environment on the basis of a
single momentary perception, since each such
glimpse occurs from only one particular perspective.
Similarly, any history book gives only a distorted

by the Citizens League have been passed by the city
council. Thus, any future proposal that is endorsed by
the Citizens League will probably be passed as well.
The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following
arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most of the Vasani grants that have been awarded
in previous years have gone to academic
biologists. Thus, if most of the Vasani grants
awarded next year are awarded to academics,
most of these will probably be biologists.
Most of the individual trees growing on the
coastal islands in this area are deciduous.
Therefore, most of the tree species on these
islands are probably deciduous varieties.
Most of the editors who have worked for the
local newspaper have not been sympathetic to
local farmers. Thus, if the newspaper hires
someone who is sympathetic to local farmers,
they will probably not be hired as an editor.
Most of the entries that were received after the
deadline for last year’s photography contest
were rejected by the judges’ committee. Thus,
the people whose entries were received after
the deadline last year will probably send them
in well before the deadline this year.
Most of the stone artifacts that have been found
at the archaeological site have been domestic
tools. Thus, if the next artifact found at the site
is made of stone, it will probably be a
domestic tool.

21. Chemist: The molecules of a certain weed-killer are
always present in two forms, one the mirror image
of the other. One form of the molecule kills weeds,
while the other has no effect on them. As a result,
the effectiveness of the weed-killer in a given
situation is heavily influenced by which of the
two forms is more concentrated in the soil, which
in turn varies widely because local soil conditions
will usually favor the breakdown of one form or
the other. Thus, much of the data on the effects of
this weed-killer are probably misleading.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the chemist’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In general, if the molecules of a weed-killer are
always present in two forms, then it is likely
that weeds are killed by one of those two forms
but unaffected by the other.
Almost all of the data on the effects of the
weed-killer are drawn from laboratory studies
in which both forms of the weed-killer’s
molecules are equally concentrated in the soil
and equally likely to break down in that soil.
Of the two forms of the weed-killer’s molecules,
the one that kills weeds is found in most local
soil conditions to be the more concentrated form.
The data on the effects of the weed-killer are
drawn from studies of the weed-killer under a
variety of soil conditions similar to those in
which the weed-killer is normally applied.
Data on the weed-killer’s effects that rely solely
on the examination of the effects of only one
of the two forms of the weed-killer’s molecules
will almost certainly be misleading.

22. Principle: A police officer is eligible for a Mayor’s
Commendation if the officer has an exemplary
record, but not otherwise; an officer eligible for
the award who did something this year that
exceeded what could be reasonably expected of a
police officer should receive the award if the act
saved someone’s life.
Conclusion: Officer Franklin should receive a Mayor’s
Commendation but Officer Penn should not.

23. Essayist: It is much less difficult to live an enjoyable
life if one is able to make lifestyle choices that
accord with one’s personal beliefs and then see
those choices accepted by others. It is possible for
people to find this kind of acceptance by choosing
friends and associates who share many of their
personal beliefs. Thus, no one should be denied
the freedom to choose the people with whom he
or she will associate.

From which one of the following sets of facts can the
conclusion be properly drawn using the principle?

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the essayist’s argument?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In saving a child from drowning this year,
Franklin and Penn both risked their lives
beyond what could be reasonably expected of
a police officer. Franklin has an exemplary
record but Penn does not.
Both Franklin and Penn have exemplary records,
and each officer saved a child from drowning
earlier this year. However, in doing so, Franklin
went beyond what could be reasonably expected
of a police officer; Penn did not.
Neither Franklin nor Penn has an exemplary
record. But, in saving the life of an accident
victim, Franklin went beyond what could be
reasonably expected of a police officer. In the
only case in which Penn saved someone’s life
this year, Penn was merely doing what could
be reasonably expected of an officer under the
circumstances.
At least once this year, Franklin has saved a
person’s life in such a way as to exceed what
could be reasonably expected of a police officer.
Penn has not saved anyone’s life this year.
Both Franklin and Penn have exemplary records.
On several occasions this year Franklin has
saved people’s lives, and on many occasions
this year Franklin has exceeded what could be
reasonably expected of a police officer. On no
occasions this year has Penn saved a person’s
life or exceeded what could be reasonably
expected of an officer.

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

No one should be denied the freedom to make
lifestyle choices that accord with his or her
personal beliefs.
One should associate with at least some people
who share many of one’s personal beliefs.
If having a given freedom could make it less
difficult for someone to live an enjoyable life,
then no one should be denied that freedom.
No one whose enjoyment of life depends, at
least in part, on friends and associates who
share many of the same personal beliefs should
be deliberately prevented from having such
friends and associates.
One may choose for oneself the people with
whom one will associate, if doing so could
make it easier to live an enjoyable life.

24. Physician: The rise in blood pressure that commonly
accompanies aging often results from a calcium
deficiency. This deficiency is frequently caused
by a deficiency in the active form of vitamin D
needed in order for the body to absorb calcium.
Since the calcium in one glass of milk per day can
easily make up for any underlying calcium
deficiency, some older people can lower their
blood pressure by drinking milk.
The physician’s conclusion is properly drawn if which
one of the following is assumed?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

There is in milk, in a form that older people
can generally utilize, enough of the active
form of vitamin D and any other substances
needed in order for the body to absorb the
calcium in that milk.
Milk does not contain any substance that is
likely to cause increased blood pressure in
older people.
Older people’s drinking one glass of milk per
day does not contribute to a deficiency in the
active form of vitamin D needed in order for
the body to absorb the calcium in that milk.
People who consume high quantities of calcium
together with the active form of vitamin D and
any other substances needed in order for the
body to absorb calcium have normal blood
pressure.
Anyone who has a deficiency in the active form
of vitamin D also has a calcium deficiency.

25. Political philosopher: A just system of taxation would
require each person’s contribution to correspond
directly to the amount the society as a whole
contributes to serve that person’s interests. For
purposes of taxation, wealth is the most objective
way to determine how well the society has served
the interest of any individual. Therefore, each
person should be taxed solely in proportion to her
or his income.
The flawed reasoning in the political philosopher’s
argument is most similar to that in which one of the
following?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Cars should be taxed in proportion to the danger
that they pose. The most reliable measure of
this danger is the speed at which a car can
travel. Therefore, cars should be taxed only in
proportion to their ability to accelerate quickly.
People should be granted autonomy in proportion
to their maturity. A certain psychological test
was designed to provide an objective measure
of maturity. Therefore, those scoring above
high school level on the test should be granted
complete autonomy.
Everyone should pay taxes solely in proportion
to the benefits they receive from government.
Many government programs provide subsidies
for large corporations. Therefore, a just tax
would require corporations to pay a greater
share of their income in taxes than individual
citizens pay.
Individuals who confer large material benefits
upon society should receive high incomes.
Those with high incomes should pay
correspondingly high taxes. Therefore, we as a
society should place high taxes on activities
that confer large benefits upon society.
Justice requires that health care be given in
proportion to each individual’s need. Therefore,
we need to ensure that the most seriously ill
hospital patients are given the highest priority
for receiving care.

26. A recent poll showed that almost half of the city’s
residents believe that Mayor Walker is guilty of ethics
violations. Surprisingly, however, 52 percent of those
surveyed judged Walker’s performance as mayor to be
good or excellent, which is no lower than it was before
anyone accused him of ethics violations.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the surprising fact stated above?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Almost all of the people who believe that Walker

before he was accused of those violations, that
his performance as mayor was poor.
In the time since Walker was accused of ethics
violations, there has been an increase in the
percentage of city residents who judge the
performance of Walker’s political opponents to
be good or excellent.
About a fifth of those polled did not know that
Walker had been accused of ethics violations.
Walker is currently up for reelection, and
anticorruption groups in the city have
expressed support for Walker’s opponent.
Walker has defended himself against the
accusations by arguing that the alleged ethics
violations were the result of honest mistakes
by his staff members.

In Alaska, tradition is a powerful legal concept,
appearing in a wide variety of legal contexts relating
to natural-resource and public-lands activities. Both
state and federal laws in the United States assign
privileges and exemptions to individuals engaged in
“traditional” activities using otherwise off-limits land
and resources. But in spite of its prevalence in
statutory law, the term “tradition” is rarely defined.
Instead, there seems to be a presumption that its
meaning is obvious. Failure to define “tradition”
clearly in written law has given rise to problematic and
inconsistent legal results.
One of the most prevalent ideas associated with
the term “tradition” in the law is that tradition is based
on long-standing practice, where “long-standing”
refers not only to the passage of time but also to the
continuity and regularity of a practice. But two recent
court cases involving indigenous use of sea otter pelts
illustrate the problems that can arise in the application
of this sense of “traditional.”
The hunting of sea otters was initially prohibited
by the Fur Seal Treaty of 1910. The Marine Mammal
Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 continued the
prohibition, but it also included an Alaska Native
exemption, which allowed takings of protected
animals for use in creating authentic native articles by
means of “traditional native handicrafts.” The U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) subsequently issued
regulations defining authentic native articles as those
“commonly produced” before 1972, when the MMPA
took effect. Not covered by the exemption, according
to the FWS, were items produced from sea otter pelts,
because Alaska Natives had not produced such
handicrafts “within living memory.”
In 1986, FWS agents seized articles of clothing
made from sea otter pelts from Marina Katelnikoff, an
Aleut. She sued, but the district court upheld the FWS
regulations. Then in 1991 Katelnikoff joined a similar
suit brought by Boyd Dickinson, a Tlingit from whom
articles of clothing made from sea otter pelts had also
been seized. After hearing testimony establishing that
Alaska Natives had made many uses of sea otters
before the occupation of the territory by Russia in the
late 1700s, the court reconsidered what constituted a
traditional item under the statute. The court now held
that the FWS’s regulations were based on a “strained
interpretation” of the word “traditional,” and that the
reference to “living memory” imposed an excessively
restrictive time frame. The court stated, “The fact that
Alaskan natives were prevented, by circumstances
beyond their control, from exercising a tradition for a

(55)

given period of time does not mean that it has been
lost forever or that it has become any less a ‘tradition.’
It defies common sense to define ‘traditional’ in such
a way that only those traditions that were exercised
during a comparatively short period in history could
qualify as ‘traditional.’”

1. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Two cases involving the use of sea otter pelts
by Alaska Natives illustrate the difficulties
surrounding the application of the legal
concept of tradition in Alaska.
Two court decisions have challenged the notion
that for an activity to be considered “traditional,”
it must be shown to be a long-standing activity
that has been regularly and continually practiced.
Two court cases involving the use of sea otter
pelts by Alaska Natives exemplify the wave of
lawsuits that are now occurring in response to
changes in natural-resource and public-lands
regulations.
Definitions of certain legal terms long taken for
granted are being reviewed in light of new
evidence that has come from historical sources
relating to Alaska Native culture.
Alaskan state laws and U.S. federal laws are
being challenged by Alaska Natives because
the laws are not sufficiently sensitive to
indigenous peoples’ concerns.

The literary development of Kate Chopin, author
of The Awakening (1899), took her through several
phases of nineteenth-century women’s fiction. Born in
1850, Chopin grew up with the sentimental novels that
formed the bulk of the fiction of the mid–nineteenth
century. In these works, authors employed elevated,
romantic language to portray female characters whose
sole concern was to establish their social positions
through courtship and marriage. Later, when she
started writing her own fiction, Chopin took as her
models the works of a group of women writers known
as the local colorists.
After 1865, what had traditionally been regarded
as “women’s culture” began to dissolve as women
entered higher education, the professions, and the
political world in greater numbers. The local colorists,
who published stories about regional life in the 1870s
and 1880s, were attracted to the new worlds opening
up to women, and felt free to move within these worlds
as artists. Like anthropologists, the local colorists
observed culture and character with almost scientific
detachment. However, as “women’s culture” continued
to disappear, the local colorists began to mourn its
demise by investing its images with mythic significance.
In their stories, the garden became a paradisal
sanctuary; the house became an emblem of female
nurturing; and the artifacts of domesticity became
virtual totemic objects.
Unlike the local colorists, Chopin devoted herself
to telling stories of loneliness, isolation, and frustration.
But she used the conventions of the local colorists to
solve a specific narrative problem: how to deal with
extreme psychological states without resorting to the
excesses of the sentimental novels she read as a youth.
By reporting narrative events as if they were part of a
region’s “local color,” Chopin could tell rather shocking
or even melodramatic tales in an uninflected manner.
Chopin did not share the local colorists’ growing
nostalgia for the past, however, and by the 1890s she
was looking beyond them to the more ambitious
models offered by a movement known as the New
Women. In the form as well as the content of their
work, the New Women writers pursued freedom and
innovation. They modified the form of the sentimental
novel to make room for interludes of fantasy and
parable, especially episodes in which women dream of
an entirely different world than the one they inhabit.
Instead of the crisply plotted short stories that had
been the primary genre of the local colorists, the New
Women writers experimented with impressionistic
methods in an effort to explore hitherto unrecorded
aspects of female consciousness. In The Awakening,
Chopin embraced this impressionistic approach more
fully to produce 39 numbered sections of uneven
length unified less by their style or content than by
their sustained focus on faithfully rendering the
workings of the protagonist’s mind.

8. Which one of the following statements most accurately
summarizes the content of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Although Chopin drew a great deal of the
material for The Awakening from the concerns
of the New Women, she adapted them, using
the techniques of the local colorists, to recapture
the atmosphere of the novels she had read in
her youth.
Avoiding the sentimental excesses of novels she
read in her youth, and influenced first by the
conventions of the local colorists and then by
the innovative methods of the New Women,
Chopin developed the literary style she used in
The Awakening.
With its stylistic shifts, variety of content, and
attention to the internal psychology of its
characters, Chopin’s The Awakening was unlike
any work of fiction written during the
nineteenth century.
In The Awakening, Chopin rebelled against the
stylistic restraint of the local colorists,
choosing instead to tell her story in elevated,
romantic language that would more accurately
convey her protagonist’s loneliness and
frustration.
Because she felt a kinship with the subject
matter but not the stylistic conventions of the
local colorists, Chopin turned to the New
Women as models for the style she was
struggling to develop in The Awakening.

9. With which one of the following statements about the
local colorists would Chopin have been most likely to
agree?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Their idealization of settings and objects
formerly associated with “women’s culture”
was misguided.
Their tendency to observe character
dispassionately caused their fiction to have
little emotional impact.
Their chief contribution to literature lay in their
status as inspiration for the New Women.
Their focus on regional life prevented them
from addressing the new realms opening up to
women.
Their conventions prevented them from
portraying extreme psychological states with
scientific detachment.

Works of fiction written in a passionate, engaged
style are more apt to effect changes in social
customs than are works written in a scientific,

Even writers who advocate social change can
end up regretting the change once it has
occurred.
Changes in social customs inevitably lead to
changes in literary techniques as writers attempt
to make sense of the new social realities.
Innovations in fictional technique grow out of
writers’ attempts to describe aspects of reality
that have been neglected in previous works.
Writers can most accurately depict extreme
psychological states by using an uninflected
manner.

Until the 1950s, most scientists believed that the
geology of the ocean floor had remained essentially
unchanged for many millions of years. But this idea
became insupportable as new discoveries were made.
First, scientists noticed that the ocean floor exhibited
odd magnetic variations. Though unexpected, this was
not entirely surprising, because it was known that
basalt—the volcanic rock making up much of the
ocean floor—contains magnetite, a strongly magnetic
mineral that was already known to locally distort
compass readings on land. This distortion is due to the
fact that although some basalt has so-called “normal”
polarity—that is, the magnetite in it has the same
polarity as the earth’s present magnetic field—other
basalt has reversed polarity, an alignment opposite that
of the present field. This occurs because in magma
(molten rock), grains of magnetite—behaving like
little compass needles—align themselves with the
earth’s magnetic field, which has reversed at various
times throughout history. When magma cools to form
solid basalt, the alignment of the magnetite grains is
“locked in,” recording the earth’s polarity at the time
of cooling.
As more of the ocean floor was mapped, the
magnetic variations revealed recognizable patterns,
particularly in the area around the other great oceanic
discovery of the 1950s: the global mid-ocean ridge, an
immense submarine mountain range that winds its way
around the earth much like the seams of a baseball.
Alternating stripes of rock with differing polarities are
laid out in rows on either side of the mid-ocean ridge:
one stripe with normal polarity and the next with
reversed polarity. Scientists theorized that mid-ocean
ridges mark structurally weak zones where the ocean
floor is being pulled apart along the ridge crest. New
magma from deep within the earth rises easily through
these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest
of the ridges to create new oceanic crust. Over millions
of years, this process, called ocean floor spreading,
built the mid-ocean ridge.
This theory was supported by several lines of
evidence. First, at or near the ridge crest, the rocks are
very young, and they become progressively older
away from the crest. Further, the youngest rocks all
have normal polarity. Finally, because geophysicists
had already determined the ages of continental volcanic
rocks and, by measuring the magnetic orientation of
these same rocks, had assigned ages to the earth’s
recent magnetic reversals, they were able to compare
these known ages of magnetic reversals with the ocean
floor’s magnetic striping pattern, enabling scientists to
show that, if we assume that the ocean floor moved
away from the spreading center at a rate of several
centimeters per year, there is a remarkable correlation
between the ages of the earth’s magnetic reversals and
the striping pattern.

the main idea of the passage?

(B)

(C)

(D)

In the 1950s, scientists refined their theories

floor was formed many millions of years ago.
The discovery of basalt’s magnetic properties in
the 1950s led scientists to formulate a new
theory to account for the magnetic striping on
the ocean floor.
In the 1950s, two significant discoveries led to
the transformation of scientific views about the
geology of the oceans.
Local distortions to compass readings are caused,
scientists have discovered, by magma that rises
through weak zones in the ocean floor to
create new oceanic crust.
The discovery of the ocean floor’s magnetic
variations convinced scientists of the need to
map the entire ocean floor, which in turn led
to the discovery of the global mid-ocean ridge.

17. The author characterizes the correlation mentioned in
the last sentence of the passage as “remarkable” in order
to suggest that the correlation
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

indicates that ocean floor spreading occurs at an
extremely slow rate
explains the existence of the global mid-ocean
ridge
demonstrates that the earth’s magnetic field is
considerably stronger than previously believed
provides strong confirmation of the ocean floor
spreading theory
reveals that the earth’s magnetic reversals have
occurred at very regular intervals

18. According to the passage, which one of the following is
true of magnetite grains?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

In the youngest basalt, they are aligned with the
earth’s current polarity.
In magma, most but not all of them align
themselves with the earth’s magnetic field.
They are not found in other types of rock
besides basalt.
They are about the size of typical grains of sand.
They are too small to be visible to the naked eye.

19. If the time intervals between the earth’s magnetic field
reversals fluctuate greatly, then, based on the passage,
which one of the following is most likely to be true?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

Compass readings are most likely to be distorted
near the peaks of the mid-ocean ridge.
It is this fluctuation that causes the ridge to
wind around the earth like the seams on a
baseball.
Some of the magnetic stripes of basalt on the
ocean floor are much wider than others.
Continental rock is a more reliable indicator of
the earth’s magnetic field reversals than is
oceanic rock.
Within any given magnetic stripe on the ocean
floor, the age of the basalt does not vary.

by the passage?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(E)

Submarine basalt found near the continents is
likely to be some of the oldest rock on the
ocean floor.
The older a sample of basalt is, the more times
it has reversed its polarity.
Compass readings are more likely to become
distorted at sea than on land.
The magnetic fields surrounding magnetite
grains gradually weaken over millions of years
on the ocean floor.
Any rock that exhibits present-day magnetic
polarity was formed after the latest reversal of
the earth’s magnetic field.

20. Which one of the following would, if true, most help to
support the ocean floor spreading theory?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

There are types of rock other than basalt that
are known to distort compass readings.
The ages of the earth’s magnetic reversals have
been verified by means other than examining
magnetite grains in rock.
Pieces of basalt similar to the type found on
the mid-ocean ridge have been found on the
continents.
Along its length, the peak of the mid-ocean
ridge varies greatly in height above the ocean
floor.
Basalt is the only type of volcanic rock found
in portions of the ocean floor nearest to the
continents.

Passage A
Central to the historian’s profession and
scholarship has been the ideal of objectivity. The
assumptions upon which this ideal rests include a
commitment to the reality of the past, a sharp separation
between fact and value, and above all, a distinction
between history and fiction.
According to this ideal, historical facts are prior
to and independent of interpretation: the value of an
interpretation should be judged by how well it accounts
for the facts; if an interpretation is contradicted by
facts, it should be abandoned. The fact that successive
generations of historians have ascribed different
meanings to past events does not mean, as relativist
historians claim, that the events themselves lack fixed
or absolute meanings.
Objective historians see their role as that of a
neutral judge, one who must never become an
advocate or, worse, propagandist. Their conclusions
should display the judicial qualities of balance and
evenhandedness. As with the judiciary, these qualities
require insulation from political considerations, and
avoidance of partisanship or bias. Thus objective
historians must purge themselves of external loyalties;
their primary allegiance is to objective historical truth
and to colleagues who share a commitment to its
discovery.

Passage B
The very possibility of historical scholarship as
an enterprise distinct from propaganda requires of its
practitioners that self-discipline that enables them to
do such things as abandon wishful thinking, assimilate
bad news, and discard pleasing interpretations that fail
elementary tests of evidence and logic.
Yet objectivity, for the historian, should not be
confused with neutrality. Objectivity is perfectly
compatible with strong political commitment. The
objective thinker does not value detachment as an end
in itself but only as an indispensable means of achieving
deeper understanding. In historical scholarship, the
ideal of objectivity is most compellingly embodied in
the powerful argument—one that reveals by its every
twist and turn its respectful appreciation of the
alternative arguments it rejects. Such a text attains
power precisely because its author has managed to
suspend momentarily his or her own perceptions so as
to anticipate and take into account objections and
alternative constructions—not those of straw men, but
those that truly issue from the rival’s position,
understood as sensitively and stated as eloquently as
the rival could desire. To mount a telling attack on a
position, one must first inhabit it. Those so habituated
to their customary intellectual abode that they cannot
even explore others can never be persuasive to anyone
but fellow habitués.
Such arguments are often more faithful to the
complexity of historical interpretation—more faithful
even to the irreducible plurality of human perspectives—
than texts that abjure position-taking altogether. The
powerful argument is the highest fruit of the kind of
thinking I would call objective, and in it neutrality

(60)

plays no part. Authentic objectivity bears no resemblance
to the television newscaster’s mechanical gesture of
allocating the same number of seconds to both sides of
a question, editorially splitting the difference between
them, irrespective of their perceived merits.

22. Both passages are concerned with answering which one
of the following questions?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

What are the most serious flaws found in recent
historical scholarship?
What must historians do in order to avoid bias
in their scholarship?
How did the ideal of objectivity first develop?
Is the scholarship produced by relativist
historians sound?
Why do the prevailing interpretations of past
events change from one era to the next?

23. Both passages identify which one of the following as a
requirement for historical research?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

the historian’s willingness to borrow methods of
analysis from other disciplines when evaluating
evidence
the historian’s willingness to employ
methodologies favored by proponents of
competing views when evaluating evidence
the historian’s willingness to relinquish favored
interpretations in light of the discovery of facts
inconsistent with them
the historian’s willingness to answer in detail all
possible objections that might be made against
his or her interpretation
the historian’s willingness to accord respectful
consideration to rival interpretations
