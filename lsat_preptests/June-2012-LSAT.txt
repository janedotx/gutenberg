The Internet makes possible the instantaneous
transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely
assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement
of printed books by digitized books that are read
mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic
devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most
digital files of books will be printed and bound on
demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly
and inexpensively make single copies that are
indistinguishable from books made in factories. Once
most books have been digitized, anyone with access to
the Internet will be able to purchase printed books
from a practically limitless digital catalog that includes
even those books that, under traditional publishing
assumptions, would have been designated “out of print.”
Also, the digital publication of a book online
involves no physical inventory, thereby eliminating the
costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers
and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail
stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This
would make digital publishing much less expensive
than traditional publishing. Given the economic
efficiency and convenience for customers of this new
digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually
supplant or at least rival traditional publishing—
although it will be some time before a catalog of
printable digitized books becomes large enough to
justify investment in book printing machines at
numerous regional sites.
Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of
expense means that under the digital publishing model,
authors would be responsible for a greater proportion
of the value of the final product and would therefore,
according to literary agents, be entitled to a larger
share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of
publishers’ revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing,
selling, and distributing physical books, costs that are
irrelevant to digital publication. Literary agents
marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected
to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for
their authors than has been traditional. But large,
established publishing houses, which are heavily
invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing,
initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity
to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart
digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional
practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive
pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce
their redundant functions in order to accommodate
higher royalty payments to authors or else they will

(55)

lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the
interval between a departing economic model and its
successor and may help explain the caution with
which today’s publishing conglomerates are approaching
the digital future.

1. Which one of the following statements most accurately
expresses the main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The shift from traditional to digital publishing is
typical of the shift from one economic model
to a more efficient economic model.
Digital publishing is likely to one day rival
traditional publishing, but social and economic
factors are currently hindering its acceptance.
Digital publishing will be convenient for readers
and profitable for publishers but will also
result in a great deal of movement by authors
among different publishing houses.
Although digital books can now be displayed on
computers and handheld electronic devices,
consumers will demonstrate that they prefer
books printed at the point of sale.
Digital publishing will transform the economics
of the publishing business and in doing so will
likely create competitive pressures to pay
authors a greater percentage of publishers’ net
revenue.

clients
the price paid to have books printed and bound
the royalties paid to authors by their publishers

Passage A
In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the
defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence
used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint
identification theory has not been adequately tested.
He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who
incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing
that no two persons have identical fingerprints.
The defendant claims that there are no established
error rates revealing how often fingerprint examiners
incorrectly identify a fingerprint as a particular person’s,
and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform,
objective standards. He cites testimony given by the
fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally
accepted standard regarding the number of “points of
identification” required for a positive identification.
Although fingerprint identification has not
attained the status of scientific law, it has been used
in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long
concurred about its reliability. While further testing
and the development of even more consistent
standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason
to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably
withstood the test of time.
While it may be true that different agencies
require different degrees of correlation before
permitting a positive identification, fingerprint
examiners are held to a consistent “points and
characteristics” approach to identification. As the
fingerprint expert testified at the defendant’s trial,
examiners are regularly subjected to testing and
proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have
been established through professional training and
peer review. The trial court below was therefore within
its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint
identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
Passage B
Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for
evaluating whether two prints “match.” There is
simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient
basis for identification. Some examiners use a “pointcounting” method that entails counting the number of
similar “ridge” characteristics on prints, but there is no
fixed requirement about how many points of similarity
are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject
point counting for a more holistic approach. Either
way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for
determining precisely when to declare a match.
Although we know that different individuals can
share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two
individuals sharing any given number of identifying
characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two
people could have four points of resemblance, or five,
or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic
identification are typically partial and smudged. Are
the odds that two partial prints from different people
will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one
in a billion? No fingerprint examiner can answer such
questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to
evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence.

(60)

(65)

The error rate for fingerprint identification in
actual practice has received little systematic study.
How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly
declare a match? Although some proficiency tests
show examiners making few or no errors, these tests
have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test
showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.

8. Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of passage B?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Criminal defendants do not always have a full
and fair opportunity to challenge faulty
fingerprint evidence when it is used against
them at trial.
Fingerprint evidence has been shown to be too
unreliable for use in criminal trials.
The error rate for fingerprint identification
is significantly higher than is generally
acknowledged.
There are a number of fundamental problems
in the field of fingerprint identification as it
is currently practiced.
There is a growing consensus within the legal
community that fingerprint evidence is often
unreliable.

9. The authors would be most likely to disagree about
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint
examiners is desirable
the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner
will incorrectly declare a match in a given
criminal case
whether fingerprint identification should be
accorded the status of scientific law
the relative merits of the point-counting and
holistic methods of fingerprint identification
whether different agencies vary in the degree
of correlation they require for examiners to
declare a match

10. It can be inferred that the author of passage A is
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

a judge presiding over an appeal of a criminal
conviction
a defense attorney arguing an appeal of a
client’s criminal conviction
a prosecutor arguing for the affirmation of a
guilty verdict
a professor of law lecturing to a criminal law class
an academic presenting a paper to a group of
legal scholars

11. Each passage discusses the relationship between the
reliability of the practice of fingerprint identification
and which one of the following?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

the ability of a criminal defendant to expose
weaknesses in the prosecution’s case
the personal integrity of individual fingerprint
examiners
differences in the identification practices used
by various fingerprint examiners
the partial or smudged prints that are typically
used as evidence in criminal cases
use of the holistic approach to fingerprint
identification

12. Which one of the following principles underlies the
arguments in both passages?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Courts should be extremely reluctant to reject
those forms of evidence that have withstood
the test of time.
Defendants should have the right to challenge
forms of evidence whose reliability has not
been scientifically proven.
To evaluate the value of fingerprint evidence,
one must know how likely it is that partial
prints from two different people would match.
Fingerprint identification should not be
considered to have a low error rate unless
rigorously conducted tests have shown this
to be so.
Fingerprint examiners must follow objective
standards if fingerprint identification is to
be reliable.

Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have
not coexisted without intruding on each other’s terrain.
Ever since what we think of as “literature” developed
out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art,
writing has aspired to the condition of music, in which
form contributes significantly to content. Nowhere is
this truer than in the African American tradition,
whose music is often considered its greatest artistic
achievement and one of the greatest contributions to
North American art. But while many African American
writers have used musicians and music as theme and
metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw
upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for
an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992
novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of
New York City in 1926.
In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only
in the novel’s plot but, more strikingly, in the way in
which the story is told. The narration slips easily from
the third-person omniscience of the narrator’s
disembodied voice—which, though sensitive and
sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or
immersion in specific social circumstances—to the
first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout
these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the
characters’ voices and protective of his or her mastery
over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the
central characters are given the responsibility of
relating their parts of the overarching story, but on
the other hand, their sections are set off by quotation
marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to
speak. In this way, the narrative is analogous in
structure to the playing of a jazz band which
intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality
of embedded solo performances.
In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington
was the first to construct his compositions with his
individual musicians and their unique “voices” in
mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians’
improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their
solos might be, they always performed within the
undeniable logic of the composer’s frame—they
always, in other words, performed as if with quotation
marks around their improvisations and solos. It is this
same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz,
a literary rendering of an art of composition that
Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which
Jazz is set.
In this novel, Morrison has found a way,
paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of
characters improvising within the fixed scope of a
carefully constructed collective narration. By
simulating the style of a genius of music while
exhibiting Morrison’s own linguistic virtuosity,
Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of
narrative point of view.

15. Which one of the following most accurately states the
main point of the passage?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

In Jazz, Morrison has realized a significant
artistic achievement in creating the first
African American work of fiction whose plot,
themes, and setting are all drawn from the
world of jazz.
Morrison’s striking description of a musical
ensemble performance containing solo
improvisations constitutes an important artistic
innovation and makes Jazz an important model
for other writers.
Although many African American writers have
used music as a central metaphor in their works,
Morrison’s 1992 novel is unique and innovative
for using jazz as its central metaphor.
Building on the works of many African
American writers and musical composers,
Morrison has over the years developed an
innovative jazzlike style of narration, which she
used especially effectively in the novel Jazz.
In Jazz, Morrison has succeeded in creating an
original and effective narrative strategy that is
a literary analogue of Duke Ellington’s style
of musical composition.

16. The author’s discussion in the first paragraph proceeds
in which one of the following ways?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

from a common claim about the arts, to a
denial of this claim as applied to a particular
artistic tradition, to a hypothesis about a
particular individual
from a general remark about two art forms, to
a similar observation about a particular
artistic tradition, to a specific comment about
a particular work that exemplifies the prior
remarks
from a description of a common claim about
two art forms, to some specific evidence that
supports that claim, to an inference regarding a
particular individual to whom that claim applies
from an observation about a specific art form,
to a more general claim about the applicability
of that observation to other art forms, to a
particular counterexample to the first observation
from general comments about the arts, to a
purported counterexample to the general
comments as applied to a particular artistic
tradition, to a description of a particular work
that bears out the original comments

He is a minor character in Morrison’s Jazz.
(D)
He composed music that was originally
intended to be performed by the specific
musicians he conducted.
(E)
Though he composed and conducted primarily

20. Each of the following excerpts from the passage exhibits
the author’s attitude toward the novel Jazz EXCEPT:
(A)
“…whose music is often considered its greatest
artistic achievement and one of the greatest
contributions to North American art” (lines 8–10)
(B)
“In Jazz, the connection to music is found not
only in the novel’s plot but, more strikingly, in
the way in which the story is told” (lines 17–19)
(C)
“The narration slips easily from the third-person
omniscience of the narrator’s disembodied

be most likely to believe which one of the following?
(A)
In Jazz, Morrison has perfected a style of
narration that had been attempted with little

(B)
Because of its use of narrative techniques
inspired by jazz, Morrison’s novel represents the
most successful representation to date of the
milieu in which jazz musicians live and work.
(C)
In Jazz, Morrison develops her narrative in such
a way that the voices of individual characters
are sometimes difficult to distinguish, in much
the same way that individual musicians’ voices
merge in ensemble jazz playing.
(D)
The structural analogy between Jazz and
Duke Ellington’s compositional style involves
more than simply the technique of shifting
between first-person and third-person narrators.
(E)
Morrison disguises the important structural
connections between her narrative and
Duke Ellington’s jazz compositions by making
the transitions between first- and third-person
narrators appear easy.

Advances in scientific understanding often do not
build directly or smoothly in response to the data that
are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision
of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial hypothesis
was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery
of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split.
Between 1934, when a group of Italian physicists
including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with
neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist
Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical
connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence
that nuclear fission had been achieved, without,
however, recognizing what they were witnessing.
Earlier, even before the neutron and proton
composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally
demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had
produced calculations indicating that in principle it
should be possible to break atoms apart. But the
neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at
achieving such a result, and researchers were not even
receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that
context. A common view was that a neutron’s breaking
apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a
pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house
to collapse.
In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that
of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of
radioactive substances produced by neutron
bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved
numerous similar results. These products remained
unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses
were hampered by the minute quantities of the
substances produced and the dangers of working with
highly radioactive materials, but more significantly
because of the expectation that they would all be
elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and
undertook related research in Sweden, but her research
partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing
experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a
surprising result: one of the substances resulting from
the neutron bombardment of uranium had been
conclusively identified as barium, an element whose
structure would have made it impossible to produce
through any mechanism he envisaged as being
involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked
that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had
occurred, it went “against all previous experiences of
nuclear physics,” but he also noted that together the
number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of
barium and technetium, the accompanying product
of the experiment, added up to the number of such
particles that compose a uranium nucleus.
It was Meitner who finally recognized the
significance of the data in relation to underlying
theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually
been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term
“nuclear fission,” she quickly submitted her
conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with

(60)

physicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and
North America rushed to corroborate the findings,
it became clear that the relevant evidence had been
present for some time, lacking mainly the right
conceptual link.

commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. Mayor: There has been a long debate in city council
about how to accommodate projected increases in
automobile traffic. Today, our choice is clear:
either we adopt my plan to build a new expressway,
or we do nothing. Doing nothing is not a viable
option because our existing system of roads
would be in gridlock within ten years given even
a conservative estimate of future traffic levels.
City council should therefore adopt my plan.
The reasoning in the mayor’s argument is most
vulnerable to which one of the following criticisms?

It fails to address the issue of the cost of traffic
gridlock to the city’s economy.

2. Museum curator: Our ancient Egyptian collection
includes an earthenware hippopotamus that
resembles a child’s toy. It was discovered in a
tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off.
We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the
dead had to wage eternal war with beasts.
Breaking the legs off a representation of an
animal was thought to help a deceased person in
this war. We conclude that, far from being a toy,
this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Which one of the following is an assumption required
by the curator’s argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The tomb in which the hippopotamus was
found was not the tomb of a child.
Earthenware figures were never used as
children’s toys in ancient Egypt.
The tomb in which the hippopotamus was
found was not reentered from the time of
burial until archaeologists opened it.
The hippopotamus’ legs were not broken
through some natural occurrence after it was
placed in the tomb.
The hippopotamus was originally placed upside
down in the tomb.

3. Lawyer: Juries are traditionally given their instructions
in convoluted, legalistic language. The verbiage is
intended to make the instructions more precise,
but greater precision is of little use if most jurors
have difficulty understanding the instructions.
Since it is more important for jurors to have a
basic but adequate understanding of their role
than it is for the details of that role to be precisely
specified, jury instructions should be formulated
in simple, easily comprehensible language.
Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer’s
argument EXCEPT:
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most jurors are less likely to understand
instructions given in convoluted, legalistic
language than instructions given in simple,
easily comprehensible language.
Most jurors do not have an adequate
understanding of their role after being
given jury instructions in convoluted,
legalistic language.
Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily
comprehensible language can adequately
describe the role of the jurors.
The details of the role of the jurors cannot be
specified with complete precision in simple,
easily comprehensible language.
Jurors do not need to know the precise details
of their role in order to have an adequate
understanding of that role.

5. Bacteria that benefit human beings when they are
present in the body are called commensals. The
bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in
the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach
ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring
H. pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune
response, many scientists now consider it a commensal.
But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of
the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis—a
bacterium that can cause tuberculosis—get sick from it,
yet no one would call M. tuberculosis a commensal.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
undermines the argument’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

The conclusion of the argument follows logically if
which one of the following is assumed?

(B)

Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?

(E)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

All neurochemical changes produce
corresponding psychological changes.
Improvements in a patient’s behavior produced
by “talk” therapy occur only through chemical
changes in the brain’s neurochemistry.
“Talk” therapy has not been effective at
bringing about psychological change.
If chemical changes in the brain’s neurochemistry
correspond to improvements in patient
behavior, then psychology and neuroscience
will eventually be indistinguishable.
Direct intervention in the brain’s neurochemistry
is likely to become a less expensive way of
treating psychological disorders than is
“talk” therapy.

Stomach ulcers caused by H. pylori and
tuberculosis can both be effectively treated
with antibiotics.
Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than
ulcers caused by H. pylori.
People who harbor M. tuberculosis derive no
benefit from its presence.
There are more people who harbor
M. tuberculosis than people who harbor
H. pylori.
There are more people who harbor H. pylori
than people who harbor M. tuberculosis.

6. Most apartments on the upper floors of The Vista Arms
apartment building have scenic views. So there is in the
building at least one studio apartment with scenic views.

4. Traditional “talk” therapy, in which a patient with a
psychological disorder discusses it with a trained
therapist, produces chemical changes in the brain.
These changes seem to correspond to improvements
in certain aspects of the patient’s behavior. Thus,
physicians will eventually be able to treat such patients
as effectively through pharmacological intervention in
the brain’s neurochemistry as through the lengthy
intermediary of traditional “talk” methods.

most help to justify Mike’s reasoning?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Using the possessions of others without their
permission is not always theft.
Generally one should tell the truth, but there are
cases in which it is permissible not to.
If people have used your property without your
permission, it is not wrong for you to use their
property without their permission.
It is permissible to treat people in a way that
is similar to the way in which they have
treated others.
Using another person’s property is wrong if
the person is harmed by that use.

8. Robinson: Wexell says that the museum wasted its
money in purchasing props and costumes from
famous stage productions, because such items
have no artistic significance outside the context
of a performance. But many of the props and
costumes are too old and fragile for use in a
performance. So clearly, the museum did not
waste its money, for displaying these items is the
only way of making them available to the public.
The reasoning in Robinson’s argument is most
vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
(A)

9. In a party game, one person leaves the room with the
understanding that someone else will relate a recent
dream to the remaining group. The person then returns
and tries to reconstruct the dream by asking only
yes-or-no questions. In fact, no dream has been related:
the group simply answers the questions according to
some arbitrary rule. Surprisingly, the person usually
constructs a dream narrative that is both coherent
and ingenious.
The example presented above most closely conforms
to which one of the following propositions?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

The presumption that something has order and
coherence can lead one to imbue it with order
and coherence.
One is less apt to reach a false understanding
of what someone says than to make no sense
out of it at all.
Dreams are often just collections of images and
ideas without coherent structures.
Interpreting another person’s dream requires
that one understand the dream as a coherent
narrative.
People often invent clever and coherent stories
to explain their behavior to other people.

10. Computer manufacturers have sought to make computer
chips ever smaller, since decreasing the size of a
computer’s central processing unit (CPU) chip—without
making that CPU chip any less sophisticated—will
proportionally increase the speed of the CPU chip and
the computer containing it. But since CPU chips cannot
be made significantly smaller without decreasing their
sophistication, computers cannot currently be made
significantly faster.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument depends?
(A)
(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Computers cannot currently be made faster
unless their CPU chips are made smaller.
Even if CPU chips are made slightly less
sophisticated, they cannot currently be made
much smaller.
If both the size and the sophistication of a
CPU chip are decreased, the speed of that
chip will decrease.
Few, if any, computer manufacturers believe that
computers can be made significantly faster.
Increasing the sophistication of a CPU chip
without increasing its size will proportionally
increase its speed.

many more species of amphibians in existence than
had previously been known. This definitely undermines
environmentalists’ claim that pollution is eliminating

between

those kinds

12. Because dried peat moss, which is derived from
sphagnum moss, contains no chemical additives and is
a renewable resource, many gardeners use large amounts
of it as a soil conditioner in the belief that the practice
is environmentally sound. They are mistaken. The
millions of acres of sphagnum moss in the world
contribute more oxygen to the atmosphere than do all
of the world’s rain forests combined, and the garden
soil industry is depleting these areas much faster than
they can renew themselves.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the argument’s reasoning?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Using a product may be environmentally
unsound even if the product is a renewable
resource and contains no chemical additive.
A practice is not environmentally sound if it
significantly reduces the amount of oxygen
entering the atmosphere.
A practice is environmentally sound if it helps
to protect rain forests that contribute large
amounts of oxygen to the atmosphere.
If the environmental benefits of a practice
outweigh the environmental costs, that
practice can be legitimately considered
environmentally sound.
If the practices of an industry threaten a vital
resource, those practices should be banned.

15. Commentator: Many social critics claim that
contemporary journalists’ cynical tendency to
look for selfish motives behind the seemingly
altruistic actions of powerful people undermines
our society’s well-being by convincing people
that success is invariably associated with greed
and mendacity. But the critics’ claim is absurd.
The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot
be a contributing factor to the undermining of our
society’s well-being, for journalists have always
been cynics. Today’s journalists are, if anything,
more restrained than their predecessors.

not improving the apartment complex; they believe that
the increased rents they could charge for improved

17. Ditalgame Corporation’s computer video games are
subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this
piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection
feature on its games. Ditalgame’s president predicts a
substantial increase in sales of the company’s games
once the new copy protection feature is implemented.
Which one of the following, if true, provides the most
support for the president’s prediction?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars
developing the new copy protection feature,
and the company can recoup these costs only
if its sales increase substantially.
Over the last several years, the market for
computer games has grown steadily, but
Ditalgame’s share of that market has shrunk
considerably.
The copy protection feature causes a copied
game to be playable just long enough for
most people to come to enjoy it so much that
they decide they have to have it.

copy computer games, generally gives
favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.

18. Columnist: It may soon be possible for an economy
to function without paper money. Instead, the

19. Social scientist: Since the body of thought known as
Marxism claims to describe rigorously an
inexorable historical movement toward the
socialization of the means of production, it
should be regarded as a scientific theory. Thus,

society, have misconstrued it.

which one of the following is assumed?

Carrie are committed to disagreeing with each other

(A)

(A)

(B)

(B)
(C)

(E)

The description that Marxism gives of certain
historical phenomena in the economic sphere
is as rigorous as it is claimed to be.
The aims of science are incompatible with the
aims of those who would seek to transform
society by political means.
Only bodies of thought consisting purely of
rigorous description are scientific theories.
Scientific theories cannot be correctly interpreted
to be, or to imply, political programs.
The means of production will inevitably become
socialized regardless of any political programs
designed to make that occur.

20. Daniel: There are certain actions that moral duty obliges
us to perform regardless of their consequences.
However, an action is not morally good simply
because it fulfills a moral obligation. No action
can be morally good unless it is performed with
the right motivations.
Carrie: Our motivations for our actions are not subject
to our conscious control. Therefore, the only
thing that can be required for an action to be
morally good is that it fulfill a moral obligation.

Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the overall conclusion of the columnist’s argument?
A society would never willingly accept a
system in which, in lieu of paper money, the
government keeps track of every transaction
electronically.
It is reasonable for people to distrust a
government that has too much power.
New technology may soon make it possible for
an economy to operate without paper money.
People are right to be unwilling to give the
government the power it would need to
operate an economy without paper money.
Even though it may be technologically feasible,
no government will be able to operate an
economy without the use of paper money.

-23-

(C)
(D)
(E)

No one can be morally required to do
something that is impossible to do.
Some actions that are performed with the right
motivations are not morally good.
All actions that fulfill moral obligations are
performed in order to fulfill moral obligations.
An action performed with the wrong
motivations cannot be morally good.
If a person’s motivations for acting are based
on a sense of duty, then that person’s action is
morally good.

22. The airport’s runways are too close to each other to
allow simultaneous use of adjacent runways when
visibility is poor, so the airport allows only 30 planes

schedules assume good weather, bad weather creates
serious delays.

23. As a general rule, the larger a social group of primates,
the more time its members spend grooming one another.
The main purpose of this social grooming is the
maintenance of social cohesion. Furthermore, group size
among primates tends to increase proportionally with the
size of the neocortex, the seat of higher thought in the
brain. Extrapolating upon the relationship between group
size and neocortex size, we can infer that early human
groups were quite large. But unexpectedly, there is
strong evidence that, apart from parents grooming their
children, these humans spent virtually no time grooming
one another.
Which one of the following, if true, would do most to
resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Early humans were much more likely to groom
themselves than are the members of other
primate species.
Early humans developed languages, which
provided a more effective way of maintaining
social cohesion than social grooming.
Early humans were not as extensively
covered with hair as are other primates,
and consequently they had less need for
social grooming.
While early humans probably lived in large
groups, there is strong evidence that they
hunted in small groups.
Many types of primates other than humans
have fairly large neocortex regions and
display frequent social grooming.

Which one of the following is most strongly supported
by the information above?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)

(E)

In poor weather, only half as many planes are
allowed to land each hour on any one runway
at the airport as are allowed to land on it in
good weather.
When the weather at the airport is good it is
likely that there are planes landing on two
adjacent runways at any given time.
If any two of the airport’s runways are used
simultaneously, serious delays result.
Airlines using the airport base their schedules
on the assumption that more than 30 planes an
hour will be allowed to land at the airport.
In good weather, there are few if any seriously
delayed flights at the airport.

sessions is constrained as follows:
Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the
same day.
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the
same day.
Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
Julio’s session must meet on an earlier day of the week
than Olivia’s.

Time—35 minutes
26 Questions
Directions: The questions in this section are based on the reasoning contained in brief statements or passages. For some
questions, more than one of the choices could conceivably answer the question. However, you are to choose the best answer; that
is, the response that most accurately and completely answers the question. You should not make assumptions that are by
commonsense standards implausible, superfluous, or incompatible with the passage. After you have chosen the best answer,
blacken the corresponding space on your answer sheet.
1. According to the official results of last week’s national
referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal.
But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted
against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most
people voted against it.
Which one of the following most accurately describes a
flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample
that is unlikely to be representative of the
general population.
The argument presumes the truth of the
conclusion that it sets out to prove.
The argument rejects a claim by attacking the
proponents of the claim rather than addressing
the claim itself.
The argument fails to make a needed distinction
between how people should have voted and how
they actually voted.
The argument defends a claim solely on the
grounds that most people believe it.

3. Some members have criticized the club’s president for
inviting Dr. Hines to speak at the annual awards banquet
without consulting other club members beforehand. But
a few years ago the previous club president hired a tax
accountant even though he had not discussed it with
club members beforehand. So the current president acted
appropriately in the way in which she invited Dr. Hines.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which
the argument relies?
(A)

(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

The previous club president had also invited
speakers without first consulting other club
members.
At the time the previous club president hired
the tax accountant, most club members did not
expect to be consulted about such matters.
Dr. Hines accepted the president’s invitation to
speak at the club’s annual awards banquet.
The club president has more discretion in hiring
an accountant than in hiring a speaker.
The club’s previous president acted appropriately
in hiring the tax accountant without first
consulting other club members.

2. Editorial: It is usually desirable for people to have
access to unregulated information, such as is
found on the Internet. But a vast array of
misinformation will always show up on the
Internet, and it is difficult to determine which
information is accurate. Accurate information is
useless unless it can easily be distinguished from
misinformation; thus, the information on the
Internet should somehow be regulated.

4. Company spokesperson: Household Products magazine
claims that our Filterator X water filter does not
remove chemical contaminants in significant
amounts. This attack on the quality of our product
is undermined by the experience of the millions
of Filterator X owners who are satisfied with the
product’s performance.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the editorial’s argument?

Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
undermines the company spokesperson’s argument?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

It is never possible to regulate misinformation
without restricting people’s access to accurate
information.
Even if information is regulated, accurate
information is often indistinguishable from
misinformation.
Regulation of information makes it easy for
people to distinguish between accurate
information and misinformation.
It is acceptable for people to have access to a
vast array of misinformation only if accurate
information is never overlooked as a result.
It is usually more desirable for people to have
access to useless, unregulated misinformation
than it is for them to have access only to
accurate but regulated information.

(B)

(C)

(D)
(E)

Household Products did not evaluate whether
the Filterator X water filter significantly
improved the taste of drinking water.
Most Filterator X owners have no way to
determine how effectively the product removes
chemical contaminants from water.
People whose household water contains chemical
contaminants are more likely than other people
to buy a Filterator X water filter.
Very few people who own a Filterator X read
Household Products on a consistent basis.
Household Products’ evaluations of Filterator X
water filters have been consistently negative.

5. A famous artist once claimed that all great art imitates
nature. If this claim is correct, then any music that is
great art would imitate nature. But while some music
may imitate ocean waves or the galloping of horses, for
example, most great music imitates nothing at all.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main point of the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Music is inferior to the other arts.
Either the artist’s claim is incorrect, or most
great music is not great art.
Like some great music, some great painting
and sculpture may fail to imitate nature.
Some elements of nature cannot be represented
adequately by great art.
Sounds that do not imitate nature are not
great music.

6. Patricia: During Japan’s Tokugawa period, martial arts
experts known as ninjas were trained for the
purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at
that time there was actually very little ninja
activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not
fear ninjas.
Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese
during the Tokugawa period had their houses
constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so
that they would receive warning if a ninja were
in the house.
Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest
counter Patricia can make to Tamara’s objection?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa
period also had houses constructed with
intentionally squeaky floors.
As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to
walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan’s
population during the Tokugawa period.
The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated
to mythic proportions in the years following
the Tokugawa period.
There were very few ninjas at any time other
than during the Tokugawa period.

7. Philosopher: Both the consequences and the motives of
human actions have bearing on the moral worth
of those actions. Nonetheless, to be a moral agent
one must have free will, because one cannot be a
moral agent without desiring to conform to a
principle.
The philosopher’s argument requires the assumption that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

one cannot be a moral agent if one lacks a
concern for the consequences of actions
desiring to conform to a principle requires free
will
nobody who acts without taking the consequences
of the action into consideration is free
it is impossible to have desires without also
being a moral agent
it is impossible to perform morally worthy actions
without at some time conforming to a principle

8. A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a
typical university library is spent on subscriptions to
scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the
average subscription rate a library pays for such a
journal has increased dramatically, even though the
costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained
fairly constant. Obviously, then, in most cases
publishing a scholarly journal must be much more
profitable now than it was several years ago.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously
weakens the argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Many university libraries have begun to charge
higher and higher fines for overdue books and
periodicals as a way of passing on increased
journal subscription costs to library users.
A university library’s acquisition budget usually
represents only a small fraction of its total
operating budget.
Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive
enterprise, and publishers of such journals
cannot survive financially if they consistently
lose money.
Most subscribers to scholarly journals are
individuals, not libraries, and the subscription
rates for individuals have generally remained
unchanged for the past several years.
The majority of scholarly journals are published
no more than four times a year.

9. Terrence Gurney suggests that because his books appeal
to a wide audience, he is not given due credit for his
literary achievements. Surely he is mistaken. Gurney’s
books tell interesting stories, but the writing is flat,
leaving no lasting impression on the reader. This is
likely the reason that Gurney has not received praise
for literary achievement.
Which one of the following most accurately states the
argument’s overall conclusion?
(A)

(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

Terrence Gurney is mistaken when he suggests
that the wide appeal of his books has
prevented him from being given due credit for
his literary achievements.
Terrence Gurney’s books are not significant
literary achievements.
Even though Terrence Gurney’s books tell
interesting stories, his writing is flat and leaves
no lasting impression on the reader.
Terrence Gurney has not been given due credit
for his literary achievements because his books
appeal to such a wide audience.
Terrence Gurney should have received some
praise for his literary achievements despite the
fact that his writing is flat and leaves no lasting
impression on the reader.

10. In an experiment designed to show how life may have
begun on Earth, scientists demonstrated that an electrical
spark—or lightning—could produce amino acids, the
building blocks of Earth’s life. However, unless the
spark occurs in a “reducing” atmosphere, that is, one
rich in hydrogen and lean in oxygen, amino acids do not
form readily and tend to break apart when they do form.
Scientists now believe that Earth’s atmosphere was
actually rich in oxygen and lean in nitrogen at the time
life began.
Assuming that the scientists’ current belief about Earth’s
atmosphere at the time life began is correct, which one
of the following, if true, would most help to explain
how lightning could have produced the first amino acids
on Earth?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

Meteorite impacts at the time life began on
Earth temporarily created a reducing
atmosphere around the impact site.
A single amino acid could have been sufficient
to begin the formation of life on Earth.
Earth’s atmosphere has changed significantly
since life first began.
Lightning was less common on Earth at the
time life began than it is now.
Asteroids contain amino acids, and some of
these amino acids could survive an asteroid’s
impact with Earth.

11. Art critic: The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism
was given to Nan Paulsen for her reviews of
automobiles. This is inappropriate. The criticism
award should be given for criticism, which Paulsen’s
reviews clearly were not. After all, cars are
utilitarian things, not works of art. And objects
that are not works of art do not reveal important
truths about the culture that produced them.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most
helps to justify the reasoning in the art critic’s argument?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism
should not be given to a writer who portrays
utilitarian objects as works of art.
Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be
considered to be criticism unless the objects
reveal important truths about the culture that
produced them.
Unless a review is written for the purpose of
revealing important truths about the writer’s
culture, that review should not be considered
to be criticism.
The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism
should not be given to writers who do not
consider themselves to be critics.
All writing that reveals important truths about a
culture should be considered to be criticism.

12. Manager: Our company’s mail-order sales have recently
increased 25 percent. This increase started around
the time we started offering unlimited free
shipping, rather than just free shipping on orders
over $50. Thus, our change in policy probably
caused the increase.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens
the manager’s argument?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

Mail-order sales have been decreasing for
companies that do not offer unlimited free
shipping.
The company did not widely advertise its
change in policy.
The company’s profits from mail-order sales
have increased since the change in policy.
The company’s change in policy occurred well
after its competitors started offering unlimited
free shipping.
Most companies offer free shipping only on
mail-order purchases over $50.

13. Proponents of nuclear power point out that new nuclear
plants are so technologically sophisticated that the
chances of a meltdown are extremely small. This is
true, but it would still be unwise to build nuclear power
plants, since the consequences of a meltdown are
absolutely catastrophic.
The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following
is most similar to that in the argument above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Many mountain climbers claim that their sport
is safe because mishaps, though often fatal, are
rare. However, mountain climbing is very risky:
although the number of mishaps is small, so is
the number of mountain climbers. Hence, the
chance of a fatal mishap during mountain
climbing is not as slim as it may seem.
Eating a serving of vegetables just once will not
improve your health. It is nonetheless prudent
to do so, for eating vegetables every day will
make you much healthier over time.
Skydivers always use two parachutes: a main
chute and an auxiliary one in case the main
chute malfunctions. Thus, the risk of a fatal
mishap is low. Nonetheless, it is foolish to
skydive, for though the risk is small, the rewards
from skydiving are also small.
The risk of serious injury when bungee jumping
is quite low. Nonetheless, it is reckless to
engage in that activity, for the injuries that
would result in the case of an accident are so
extreme that it is not worth the risk.
People complain about having to wear seat belts
because they believe the chances of traffic
accidents are slim. This is true; on any given
trip it is unlikely that a collision will occur.
However, it is still unwise to ride in a car
without a seat belt, for the effort it takes to
put one on is minimal.

14. University president: Research institutions have an
obligation to promote research in any field of
theoretical investigation if that research shows
some promise of yielding insights into the causes
of practical problems that affect people’s quality
of life.
The principle stated by the university president, if valid,
most helps to justify which one of the following
actions?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

A university denies a grant application from a
faculty member for work on a solution to a
famous mathematical puzzle that has no
relation to practical concerns.
A government agency funds a research project
in astrophysics designed to determine whether
there are theoretical limits on the magnitude of
planets in distant solar systems.
A university funds a research position in the
physics department that involves no teaching
but has the responsibility for managing all the
grant applications by members of the physics
faculty.
A foundation decides not to fund a research
proposal in applied mathematics that sought
to model certain poorly understood aspects of
economic behavior.
A research institute funds an investigation into
the mathematical properties of folded structures
that is likely to aid in understanding the
structure of proteins that cause disease.

15. Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the
hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions
such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office
workers found that, among those who do similar amounts
of typing, workers reporting the least control over their
own work had almost three times the risk of developing
carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the
most control.

16. Principle: Employees of telemarketing agencies should
never do anything that predisposes people to
dislike the agencies’ clients.
Application: If an employee of a telemarketing agency
has been told by a person the employee has called
that he or she does not want to buy the product of
a client of the agency, the employee should not
try to talk that person into doing so.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to
explain the study’s findings?

Which one of the following, if true, justifies the given
application of the principle above?

(A)

(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Office workers who have the most control over
their own work tend to do significantly less
typing than do those who have the least
control over their own work.
Feeling a lack of control over one’s own work
tends to put one under emotional stress that
makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
The keyboards on which office workers type
tend to put typists’ arms and hands in positions
that promote the development of carpal tunnel
syndrome.
Among office workers who rarely use keyboards,
the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much
higher for those who feel that they lack control
over their own work.
Office workers who have the most control over
their own work tend to perform repetitive
motions other than typing more often than do
office workers with the least control over their
own work.

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Any employee of a telemarketing agency is
likely to be able to determine whether trying
to talk someone into buying the product of a
client of the agency after the person has said
that he or she does not want to will likely
engender animosity toward the client.
Some employees of telemarketing agencies are
unlikely to be certain about whether trying to
talk someone into buying the product of a
client of the agency after the person has said
that he or she does not want to will likely
engender animosity toward the client.
Any employee of a telemarketing agency who
tries to get someone to buy the product of a
client of the agency after the person has said
that he or she does not want to will engender
animosity toward the client.
Some people that an employee of a
telemarketing agency calls to ask them to buy
the product of a client of the agency will
refuse to do so even though they are not
predisposed to dislike the client.
People who are already predisposed to dislike
the client of a telemarketing agency are more
likely to refuse to buy the product of that
client than are people who are predisposed to
like the client.

17. Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger
than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed
in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected
from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune’s
largest moon, was captured by Neptune’s gravity.
The conclusion of the argument follows logically if
which one of the following is assumed?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon
and a planet.
Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere
and orbit the sun are true planets.
If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit
around Neptune, Pluto would not have its
current orbit around the sun and would still
be a moon.
The size of a celestial body in orbit around the
sun is not relevant to determining whether or
not it is a true planet.
For a celestial body to be a true planet it must
have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.

18. A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial
requirement for the evolution of the anatomically
modern human brain, a process that began among our
early human ancestors. Food resources that could
support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in
the shore environments that were available to early
humans. Nevertheless, the human brain’s evolution took
place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Which one of the following, if true, would most help to
resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Early humans had a significantly lower
metabolic rate than anatomically modern
humans, allowing them to expend their fat
reserves more efficiently.
The brains of the earliest known humans were
30 percent smaller than the anatomically
modern human brain.
Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered
more reliable and abundant resources than they
do today.
The techniques used to explore the archaeology
of prehistoric shore sites have only recently
been developed.
Gathering food in shore environments required
a significantly greater expenditure of calories
by early humans than did gathering food in
other environments.

20. University president: We will be forced to reduce
spending next year if we do not increase our
enrollment. So, if we are to maintain the quality
of the education we provide, we must market our
programs more aggressively. Without such
marketing we will be unable to increase our
enrollment.
The conclusion of the university president’s argument
can be properly drawn if which one of the following
is assumed?
(A)

(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

The university will not maintain the quality of
the education it provides if it increases its
enrollment.
The university will not need to reduce spending
next year if it increases its enrollment.
The university will increase its enrollment if it
markets its programs more aggressively.
The university will not maintain the quality of
the education it provides if it reduces spending
next year.
The university will not need to reduce
spending next year if it markets its programs
more aggressively.

21. If the city starts requiring residents to sort the materials
that they put out for recycling, then many residents will
put more recyclables in with their regular garbage. This
will result in more recyclables being buried in the city’s
landfill. However, because of the cost of having city
workers do the sorting, the sanitation department will
not stay within its budget unless the sorting requirement
for residents is implemented.

Which one of the following statements logically follows
from the information above?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

Most of the city’s residents will continue to
recycle even if a sorting requirement is
implemented.
If the city starts requiring residents to sort their
recyclables, then all of the residents who
continue to recycle will sort their recyclables.
Implementing the sorting requirement would not
cause the city’s annual cost of sending garbage
to its landfill to exceed its current annual cost
of sorting recyclables.
The amount of recyclables going to the city’s
landfill will increase if the sanitation department
stays within its budget.
If the city implements the sorting requirement,
the sanitation department will stay within its
budget.

22. Meerkat “sentinels,” so-called because they watch for
predators while other meerkat group members forage,
almost never fall victim to those predators, yet the
foragers often do. This advantage accruing to the
sentinel does not mean that its watchful behavior is
entirely self-interested. On the contrary, the sentinel’s
behavior is an example of animal behavior motivated at
least in part by altruism. The loud bark emitted by the
sentinel as it dashes for the cover of the nearest hole
alerts other group members to the presence of danger.
Which one of the following is a questionable reasoning
technique employed in the argument?
(A)
(B)
(C)

(D)

(E)

appealing to evidence that tends to undermine
rather than support the argument’s conclusion
appealing to evidence that presupposes the truth
of the argument’s conclusion
inferring solely from an effect produced by an
action that a purpose of the action is to produce
that effect
inferring solely from the claim that the behavior
of a meerkat sentinel is not entirely selfish that
this behavior is entirely altruistic
concluding that a claim is false on the grounds
that insufficient evidence has been offered to
support it

23. Alex: Shrimp farming results in damage to the
environment, because investors make quick profits
from such farming and then abandon the farms.
Jolene: I disagree. Although some shrimp farms have
proved unsustainable and have been quickly
abandoned, properly built shrimp farms take a
long time to construct and are costly to operate.
Most owners try to make sure that their farms
are productive for many years.
Their dialogue provides the most support for the claim
that Alex and Jolene disagree with each other over
whether
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)
(E)

most owners of shrimp farms eventually
abandon their farms
shrimp farming often yields a quick, easy profit
shrimp farming hardly ever damages the
environment
abandonment of a shrimp farm results in
damage to the environment
some shrimp farmers are environmentally
irresponsible

24. No one who works at Leila’s Electronics has received
both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester
has not received a raise, so it must be that he has
received a poor performance evaluation.
The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most
similar to the reasoning in which one of the following
arguments?
(A)

(B)

(C)

(D)

(E)

No one who lives in a house both owns it and
pays rent on it. So, since my next-door
neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be
that they do not own it.
No one who lives in a house both owns it and
pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own
their house. Therefore, it must be that they do
not pay rent on it.
My neighbors have not paid any rent on their
house. Since anyone who lives in a house but
does not rent it owns it, it must be that they
own it.
My next-door neighbors do not own their
house. Since no one who lives in a house both
owns it and pays rent on it, it must be that my
next-door neighbors pay rent on their house.
Anyone who lives in a house but does not own
it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do
not own their house. Therefore, it must be that

25. Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced
negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the
incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon
cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in
many non-Western countries where people eat more
fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables.
Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively
shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given
area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals,
which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fiber. All
of this shows that insufficient consumption of fiber
causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber
prevents it.
The argument’s reasoning is vulnerable to criticism
because the argument overlooks the possibility that
(A)
(B)
(C)
(D)

(E)

the consumption of fiber in many countries is
rising appreciably
the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by
high-fiber diets
fiber is difficult for many people to include in
their diets
the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber
in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to
different degrees
foods containing fiber also contain other
substances that, when consumed, tend to
prevent colon cancer

26. Anthropologist: Many people think that if human
language evolved, then something like it must be
present in those species most closely related to
humans, such as chimpanzees. They reason that
since new traits evolve gradually, something like
human language, albeit cruder, must exist in some
species from which humans evolved. This general
line of argument may be reasonable, but it simply
does not follow that chimpanzees have anything
like human language, because humans did not
evolve from chimpanzees. While chimpanzees are
indeed closely related to humans, this is because
both evolved from a common ancestor. The
evolution of human language might easily have
begun after the extinction of that common
ancestor.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses
the main conclusion of the anthropologist’s argument?
(A)
(B)

(C)
(D)
(E)

Humans did not evolve from chimpanzees, but
rather from some extinct species.
The assumption that something like human
language must exist in some species from
which humans evolved has no clearcut
linguistic implications for chimpanzees.
The communicative systems of chimpanzees
are cruder than human language.
Human language is a by-product of human
intelligence, which chimpanzees lack.
The evolution of human language began after
the disappearance of an extinct species from
which both humans and chimpanzees evolved.
