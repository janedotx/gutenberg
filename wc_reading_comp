The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR), approved by the United Nations General
Assembly in 1948, was the first international treaty to
expressly affirm universal respect for human rights.
Prior to 1948 no truly international standard of
humanitarian beliefs existed. Although Article 1 of 
the 1945 UN Charter had been written with the
express purpose of obligating the UN to âencourage
respect for human rights and for fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, 
language, or religion,â there were members of
delegations from various small countries and
representatives of several nongovernmental
organizations who felt that the language of Article 1
was not strong enough, and that the Charter as a 
whole did not go far enough in its efforts to
guarantee basic human rights. This group lobbied
vigorously to strengthen the Charterâs human rights
provisions and proposed that member states be
required âto take separate and joint action and to
co-operate with the organization for the promotion of
human rights.â This would have implied an obligation
for member states to act on human rights issues.
Ultimately, this proposal and others like it were not
adopted; instead, the UDHR was commissioned and
drafted.
The original mandate for producing the document
was given to the UN Commission on Human Rights
in February 1946. Between that time and the General
Assemblyâs final approval of the document, the
UDHR passed through an elaborate eight-stage
drafting process in which it made its way through
almost every level of the UN hierarchy. The articles
were debated at each stage, and all 30 articles were 
argued passionately by delegates representing diverse
ideologies, traditions, and cultures. The document as
it was finally approved set forth the essential
principles of freedom and equality for everyoneâ
regardless of sex, race, color, language, religion,
political or other opinion, national or social origin,
property, birth or other status. It also asserted a
number of fundamental human rights, including
among others the right to work, the right to rest and
leisure, and the right to education.
While the UDHR is in many ways a progressive
document, it also has weaknesses, the most
regrettable of which is its nonbinding legal status. For
all its strong language and high ideals, the UDHR
remains a resolution of a purely programmatic nature.
Nevertheless, the document has led, even if belatedly,
to the creation of legally binding human rights



conventions, and it clearly deserves recognition as an
international standard-setting piece of work, as a set
of aspirations to which UN member states are
intended to strive, and as a call to arms in the name
of humanity, justice, and freedom.
