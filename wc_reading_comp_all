In the 1980s there was a proliferation of poetry collections, short stories, and novels published by women of Latin American descent in the United States. By the end of the decade, another genre of
 U.S. Latina writing, the autobiography, also came into prominence with the publication of three notable autobiographical collections: Loving in the War Years: Lo Que Nunca PasoÌ Por Sus Labios, by CherriÌe Moraga; Getting Home Alive, by Aurora Levins
 Morales and Rosario Morales; and Borderlands/ La Frontera, by Gloria AnzalduÌa.
These collections are innovative at many levels. They confront traditional linguistic boundaries by using a mix of English and Spanish, and they each
 address the politics of multiple cultural identities by exploring the interrelationships among such factors as ethnicity, gender, and language. This effort manifests itself in the generically mixed structure of these works, which combine essays, sketches, short stories, poems,
 and journal entries without, for the most part, giving preference to any of these modes of presentation.
In Borderlands/La Frontera, AnzalduÌa presents her personal history and the history of the Mexican American community to which she belongs by
 juxtaposing narrative sequences and poetry. Moragaâs Loving in the War Years is likewise characterized by a mixture of genres, and, as she states in her introduction, the events in her life story are not arranged chronologically, but rather in terms of her
 political development. According to one literary critic who specializes in the genre of autobiography, this departure from chronological ordering represents an important difference between autobiographies written by women and those traditionally written by men.
 Getting Home Alive departs even further from the conventions typical of autobiography by bringing together the voices of two people, a mother and her daughter, each of whom authors a portion of the text. The narratives and poems of each author are not
 assigned to separate sections of the text, but rather are woven together, with a piece by one sometimes commenting on a piece by the other. While this ordering may seem fragmentary and confusing, it is in fact a fully intentional and carefully designed
 experiment with literary structure. In a sense, this mixing of structures parallels the content of these autobiographies: the writers employ multigeneric and multivocal forms to express the complexities inherent in the formation of their identities.
 Rather than forcing their personal histories to conform to existing generic parameters, these writers have revolutionized the genre of autobiography,
redrawing the boundaries of this literary form to make
it more amenable to the expression of their own  experiences. In doing so, they have shown a strong
determination to speak for themselves in a world that they feel has for too long taken their silence for granted.

While recent decades have seen more information recorded than any other era, the potential for losing this information is now greater than ever. This prospect is of great concern to archivists, who are charged with
 preserving vital records and documents indefinitely. One archivist notes that while the quantity of material being saved has increased exponentially, the durability of recording media has decreased almost as rapidly. The clay tablets that contain the laws of ancient
 Mesopotamia, for example, are still displayed in museums around the world, and many medieval manuscripts written on animal parchment still look as though they were copied yesterday, whereas books printed on acidic paper as recently as the 1980s are
 already unreadable. Black-and-white photographs will last for a couple of centuries, but most color photographs become unstable within 40 years, and videotapes last only about 20 years.
Computer technology would seem to offer  archivists an answer, as maps, photographs, films,
videotapes, and all forms of printed material may now be transferred to and stored electronically on computer disks or tape, occupying very little space. But as the pace of technological change increases, so too does
 the speed with which each new generation of technology supplants the last. For example, many documents and images transferred in the 1980s to optical computer disksâthen the cutting edge of technologyâmay not now be retrievable because
 they depend on computer software and hardware that are no longer available. And recent generations of digital storage tape are considered safe from deterioration for only ten years. Yet, even as some archivists are reluctant to become dependent on
 ever-changing computer technology, they are also quickly running out of time.
Even if viable storage systems are developedâ new computer technologies are emerging that may soon provide archivists with the information storage
 durability they requireâdecisions about what to keep and what to discard will have to be made quickly, as materials recorded on conventional media continue to deteriorate. Ideally, these decisions should be informed by an assessment of the value of each document.
 Printed versions of ancient works by Homer and Virgil, for example, survived intact because their enduring popularity resulted in multiple copies of the works being made at different historical moments. But many great works, including those of Plato, were
 lost for several centuries and are known today only because random copies turned up in the archives of medieval monasteries or in other scholarly collections. Undoubtedly, many important works have not survived at all. The danger now is not so much that some recent
 masterpiece will be lost for an extended period of time, but rather that the sheer volume of accumulated records stored on nondurable media will make it virtually impossible for archivists to sort the essential from the dispensable in time to save it.

A proficiency in understanding, applying, and even
formulating statutesâthe actual texts of laws enacted
by legislative bodiesâis a vital aspect of the practice
of law, but statutory law is often given too little
attention by law schools. Much of legal education, with
its focus on judicial decisions and analysis of cases,
can give a law student the impression that the practice
of law consists mainly in analyzing past cases to
determine their relevance to a clientâs situation and
arriving at a speculative interpretation of the law
relevant to the clientâs legal problem.
Lawyers discover fairly soon, however, that much
of their practice does not depend on the kind of
painstaking analysis of cases that is performed in law
school. For example, a lawyer representing the owner
of a business can often find an explicit answer as to
what the client should do about a certain tax-related
issue by consulting the relevant statutes. In such a case
the facts are clear and the statutesâ relation to them
transparent, so that the clientâs question can be
answered by direct reference to the wording of the
statutes. But statutesâ meanings and their applicability
to relevant situations are not always so obvious, and
that is one reason that the ability to interpret them
accurately is an essential skill for law students to learn.
Another skill that teaching statutory law would
improve is synthesis. Law professors work hard at
developing their studentsâ ability to analyze individual
cases, but in so doing they favor the ability to apply the
law in particular cases over the ability to understand
the interrelations among laws. In contrast, the study of
all the statutes of a legal system in a certain small area
of the law would enable the student to see how these
laws form a coherent whole. Students would then be
able to apply this ability to synthesize in other areas of
statutory law that they encounter in their study or
practice. This is especially important because most
students intend to specialize in a chosen area, or areas,
of the law.
One possible argument against including training in
statutory law as a standard part of law school curricula
is that many statutes vary from region to region within
a nation, so that the mastery of a set of statutes would
usually not be generally applicable. There is some truth
to this objection; law schools that currently provide
some training in statutes generally intend it as a
preparation for practice in their particular region, but
for schools that are nationally oriented, this could seem
to be an inappropriate investment of time and
resources. But while the knowledge of a particular
regionâs statutory law is not generally transferable to
other regions, the skills acquired in mastering a
particular set of statutes are, making the study of
statutory law an important undertaking even for law
schools with a national orientation.

The Japanese American sculptor Isamu Noguchi
(1904â1988) was an artist who intuitively askedâand
responded toâdeeply original questions. He might
well have become a scientist within a standard
scientific discipline, but he instead became an artist
who repeatedly veered off at wide angles from the
well-known courses followed by conventionally
talented artists of both the traditional and modern
schools. The story behind one particular sculpture
typifies this aspect of his creativeness.
By his early twenties, Noguchiâs sculptures
showed such exquisite comprehension of human
anatomy and deft conceptual realization that he won a
Guggenheim Fellowship for travel in Europe. After
arriving in Paris in 1927, Noguchi asked the
Romanian-born sculptor Constantin Brancusi if he
might become his student. When Brancusi said no,
that he never took students, Noguchi asked if he
needed a stonecutter. Brancusi did. Noguchi cut and
polished stone for Brancusi in his studio, frequently
also polishing Brancusiâs brass and bronze sculptures.
Noguchi, with his scientistâs mind, pondered the fact
that sculptors through the ages had relied exclusively
upon negative lightâthat is, shadowsâfor their
conceptual communication, precisely because no
metals, other than the expensive, nonoxidizing gold,
could be relied upon to give off positive-light reflections.
Noguchi wanted to create a sculpture that was
purely reflective. In 1929, after returning to the
United States, he met the architect and philosopher
R. Buckminster Fuller, offering to sculpt a portrait of
him. When Fuller heard of Noguchiâs ideas regarding
positive-light sculpture, he suggested using chromenickel steel, which Henry Ford, through automotive
research and development, had just made
commercially available for the first time in history.
Here, finally, was a permanently reflective surface,
economically available in massive quantities.
In sculpting his portrait of Fuller, Noguchi did not
think of it as merely a shiny alternate model of
traditional, negative-light sculptures. What he saw
was that completely reflective surfaces provided a
fundamental invisibility of surface like that of utterly
still waters, whose presence can be apprehended only
when objectsâa shipâs mast, a tree, or skyâare reflected
in them. Seaplane pilots making offshore landings in
dead calm cannot tell where the water is and must
glide in, waiting for the unpredictable touchdown.
Noguchi conceived a similarly invisible sculpture,
hidden in and communicating through the reflections
of images surrounding it. Then only the distortion of
familiar shapes in the surrounding environment could
be seen by the viewer. The viewerâs awareness of the
âinvisibleâ sculptureâs presence and dimensional
relationships would be derived only secondarily.
Even after this stunning discovery, Noguchi
remained faithful to his inquisitive nature. At the
moment when his explorations had won critical
recognition of the genius of his original and
fundamental conception, Noguchi proceeded to the
next phase of his evolution.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR), approved by the United Nations General
Assembly in 1948, was the first international treaty to
expressly affirm universal respect for human rights.
Prior to 1948 no truly international standard of
humanitarian beliefs existed. Although Article 1 of 
the 1945 UN Charter had been written with the
express purpose of obligating the UN to âencourage
respect for human rights and for fundamental
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, 
language, or religion,â there were members of
delegations from various small countries and
representatives of several nongovernmental
organizations who felt that the language of Article 1
was not strong enough, and that the Charter as a 
whole did not go far enough in its efforts to
guarantee basic human rights. This group lobbied
vigorously to strengthen the Charterâs human rights
provisions and proposed that member states be
required âto take separate and joint action and to
co-operate with the organization for the promotion of
human rights.â This would have implied an obligation
for member states to act on human rights issues.
Ultimately, this proposal and others like it were not
adopted; instead, the UDHR was commissioned and
drafted.
The original mandate for producing the document
was given to the UN Commission on Human Rights
in February 1946. Between that time and the General
Assemblyâs final approval of the document, the
UDHR passed through an elaborate eight-stage
drafting process in which it made its way through
almost every level of the UN hierarchy. The articles
were debated at each stage, and all 30 articles were 
argued passionately by delegates representing diverse
ideologies, traditions, and cultures. The document as
it was finally approved set forth the essential
principles of freedom and equality for everyoneâ
regardless of sex, race, color, language, religion,
political or other opinion, national or social origin,
property, birth or other status. It also asserted a
number of fundamental human rights, including
among others the right to work, the right to rest and
leisure, and the right to education.
While the UDHR is in many ways a progressive
document, it also has weaknesses, the most
regrettable of which is its nonbinding legal status. For
all its strong language and high ideals, the UDHR
remains a resolution of a purely programmatic nature.
Nevertheless, the document has led, even if belatedly,
to the creation of legally binding human rights



conventions, and it clearly deserves recognition as an
international standard-setting piece of work, as a set
of aspirations to which UN member states are
intended to strive, and as a call to arms in the name
of humanity, justice, and freedom.
