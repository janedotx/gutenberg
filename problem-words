voltage (occurs just once in 'high-voltage' in preptest 52, so it gets messed up by any regex starting with a ^)
resent (if you take out the ^ ugh, it shows up in "present")
mere (problem with the x in there...)

warehouse v versus n
pass ("muster" or "inspection") that connotation isn't going to show up in lemma.num
sap v versus sap n
